<CENTER>PUBLISHER&#8217;S PREFACE</CENTER>
<P>
RELIGION, says Noah Webster in his <i>American
Dictionary of the English Language</i>, is derived
from &#8220;Religo, to bind anew;&#8221; and, in this <i>History
of a False Religion</i>, our author has shown how
easily its votaries were insnared, deceived, and
mentally bound in a labyrinth of falsehood and
error, by a designing knave, who established a new
religion and a new order of priesthood by imposing
on their ignorance and credulity.

<P>

  The history of the origin of one supernatural
religion will, with slight alterations, serve to
describe them all. Their claim to credence rests on
the exhibition of so-called miracles&#8212;that is, on
a violation of the laws of nature,&#8212;for, if
religions were founded on the demonstrated truths of
science, there would be no mystery, no
supernaturalism, no miracles, no skepticism, no
false religion. We would have only verified truths
and demonstrated facts for the basis of our belief.
But this simple foundation does not satisfy the
unreasoning multitude. They demand signs, portents,
mysteries, wonders and miracles for their faith and
the supply of prophets, knaves and impostors has
always been found ample to satisfy this abnormal
demand of credulity.

<P>

  Designing men, even at the present day, find
little difficulty in establishing new systems of
faith and belief. Joseph Smith, who invented the
Mormon religion, had more followers and influence in
this country at his death, than the Carpenter&#8217;s Son
obtained centuries ago from the unlettered
inhabitants of Palestine; and yet Smith achieved his
success among educated people in this so-called
enlightened age, while Jesus taught in an age of
semi-barbarism and faith, when both Jews and Pagans
asserted and believed that beasts, birds, reptiles
and even fishes understood human language, were
often gifted with human speech, and sometimes seemed
to possess even more than ordinary human
intelligence.

<P>

  They taught that the serpent, using the language
of sophistry, beguiled Eve in Eden, who in turn
corrupted Adam, her first and only husband. At the
baptism of Jesus by John in the river Jordan, the
voice of a dove resounded in the heavens, saying,
quite audibly and distinctly, &#8220;Thou art my beloved
Son; in thee I am well pleased.&#8221; Balaam disputed
with his patient beast of burden, on their celebrated
journey in the land of Moab, and the ass proved
wiser in the argument that ensued than the inspired
prophet who bestrode him, The great fish Oannes
left his native element and taught philosophy to the
Chaldeans on dry land. One reputable woman, of
Jewish lineage,&#8212;the mother of an interesting
family&#8212;was changed to a pillar of salt in Sodom
while another female of great notoriety known to
fame as the celebrated &#8220;Witch of Endor,&#8221; raised
Samuel from his grave in Ramah. Saint Peter found a
shilling in the mouth of a fish which he caught in
the Sea of Galilee, and this lucky incident enabled
the impecunious apostle to pay the &#8220;tribute money&#8221;
in Capernaum. Another famous Israelite,&#8212;so it is
said,&#8212;broke the record of balloon ascensions in
Judea, and ascended into heaven in a chariot of
fire.

<P>

  In an age of ignorance wonders abound, prodigies
occur, and miracles become common, The untaught
masses are easily deceived, and their unreasoning
credulity enables them to proudly boast of their
unquestioning faith. When their feelings are excited
and their passions aroused by professional
evangelists, they even profess to believe that which
they cannot comprehend; and, in the satirical
language of Bulwer, they endeavor to &#8220;<i>assist
their ignorance by the conjectures of their
superstition</i>.&#8221;

<P>

  Among the multitudes of diverse and opposing
religions which afflict mankind, it is self-evident
that but one religion may justly claim the
inspiration of truth, and it is equally evident to
all reasoning minds that that religion is the
religion of kindness and humanity,&#8212;the religion
of noble thoughts and generous deeds,&#8212;which
removes the enmities of race and creed, and &#8220;makes
the whole world kin!&#8221; And which, in its observance
is blessed with sympathy, friendship, happiness and
love.

<P>

  This religion needs no creed, no profession of
faith, no incense, no prayer, no penance, no
sacrifice. Its whole duty consists in comforting the
afflicted, assisting the unfortunate, protecting the
helpless, and in honestly fulfilling our duties to
our fellow mortals. In the language of Confucius,
the ancient Chinese Sage, it is simply &#8220;to behave to
others as I would require others to behave to me.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Do unto others as you would they should do
unto you,&#8221; says Jesus; and in the Epistle of James,
we are told that &#8220;Pure Religion and undefiled
before God and the Father is this, To visit the
fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
keep himself unspotted from the world.&#8221;

<P>

  The same benign and generous conduct is commended
in even grander and nobler language in the lectures
to the French Masonic Lodges: &#8220;Love one another,
teach one another, help one another. That is all our
doctrine, all our science, all our law.&#8221;

<P>

It is believed that the learned dissertation of
Lord Brougham on the <i>Origin of Evil</i>, which is
annexed to this work, will need no commendation
to ensure its careful perusal.

<CENTER><H2>AN ALLEGORY OF THE STARS.</H2></CENTER>
<HR width=70 align=center>
And the Stars sat, each on his ruby throne, and
watched with sleepless eyes upon the world.
It was the night ushering in the new year, a
night on which every star receives from the archangel
that then visits the universal galaxy, its
peculiar charge.

<P>The destinies of men and empires are then portioned
forth for the coming year, and, unconsciously
to ourselves, our fates become minioned to the
stars.

<P>A hushed and solemn night is that in which
the dark gates of time open to receive the ghost of
the dead year, and the young and radiant stranger
rushes forth from the clouded chasms of eternity.
On that night, it is said that there are given to
the spirits that we see not, a privilege and a power;
the dead are troubled in their forgotten graves, and
men feast and laugh, while demon and angel are
contending for their doom.

<P>It was night in heaven; all was unutterably
silent, the music of the spheres had paused, and
not a sound came from the angels of the stars; and
they who sat upon those shining thrones were
three thousand and ten, each resembling each.

<P>Eternal youth clothed their radiant limbs with
celestial beauty, and on their faces was written the
dread of calm, that fearful stillness which feels not,
sympathizes not with the dooms over which it
broods.

<P>War, tempest, pestilence, the rise of empires,
and their fall, they ordain, they, compass, unexultant
and uncompassionate. The fell and thrilling
crimes that stalk abroad when the world sleeps&#8212;the
parricide with his stealthy step, and horrent
brow, and lifted knife; the unwifed mother that
glides out and looks behind, and behind, and
shudders, and casts her babe upon the river, and
hears the wail, and pities not&#8212;the splash, and
does not tremble!

<P>These the starred kings behold&#8212;to these they
lead the unconscious step; but the guilt blanches
not their lustre, neither doth remorse wither their
unwrinkled youth.

<P>Each star wore a kingly diadem; round the loins
of each was a graven belt, graven with many and
mighty signs; and the foot of each was on a burning
ball, and the right arm dropped over the knee
as they bent down from their thrones; they moved
<!-- Page 5 -->
not a limb or feature, save the finger of the right
hand, which ever and anon moved slowly, pointing,
and regulated the fates of men as the hand of the
dial speaks the career of time.

<P>One only of the three thousand and ten wore not
the same aspect as his crowned brethren; a star,
smaller than the rest, and less luminous. The countenance
of this star was not impressed with the
awful calmness of the others; but there were sullenness
and discontent upon his mighty brow.

<P>And this star said to himself&#8212;&#8220;Behold, I am
created less glorious than my fellows, and the archangel
apportions not to me the same lordly destinies.
Not for me are the dooms of kings and
bards, the rulers of empires, or, yet nobler, the
swayers and harmonists of souls. Sluggish are the
spirits and base the lot of the men I am ordained
to lead through a dull life to a fameless grave. And
wherefore?&#8212;Is it mine own fault, or is it the fault
which is not mine, that I was woven of beams less
glorious than my brethren? Lo! when the archangel
comes, I will bow not my crowned head to
his decrees. I will speak, as the ancestral Lucifer
before me: <i>he</i> rebelled because of his glory, <i>I</i> because
of my obscurity; <i>he</i> from the ambition of
pride, and <i>I</i> from its discontent.&#8221;

<P>And while the star was thus communing with
himself, the upward heavens were parted as by a
long river of light, and adown that stream swiftly,
<!-- Page 6 -->
and without sound, sped the archangel visitor of
the stars; his vast limbs floated in the liquid lustre,
and his outspread wings, each plume the glory of
a sun, bore him noiselessly along; but thick clouds
veiled his lustre from the eyes of mortals, and
while above all was bathed in the serenity of his
splendor, tempest and storm broke below over the
children of the earth:

<P>&#8220;He bowed the heavens and came down, and
darkness was under his feet.&#8221;

<P>And the stillness on the faces of the stars became
yet more still, and the awfulness was humbled into
awe. Right above their thrones paused the course
of the archangel; and his wings stretched from
east to west, overshadowing with the shadow of
light the immensity of space. Then forth in the
shining stillness, rolled the dread music of his
voice: and, fulfilling the heraldry of god, to each
star he appointed the duty and the charge, and
each star bowed his head yet lower as he heard the
fiat, while his throne rocked and trembled at the
majesty of the word. But at last, when each of
the brighter stars had, in succession, received the
mandate, and the viceroyalty over the nations of
the earth, the purple and diadems of kings&#8212;the
archangel addressed the lesser star as he sat apart
from his fellows

<P>&#8220;Behold,&#8221; said the archangel, &#8220;the rude tribes
of the north, the fishermen of the river that flows
<!-- Page 7 -->
beneath, and the hunters of the forests, that darken
the mountain-tops with verdure! these be thy
charge, and their destinies thy care. Nor deem
thou, O star of the sullen beams, that thy duties
are less glorious than the duties of thy brethren;
for the peasant is not less to thy master and mine
than the monarch; nor doth the doom of empires
rest more upon the sovereign than on the herd.
The passions and the heart are the dominion of the
stars&#8212;a mighty realm; nor less mighty beneath
the hide that garbs the shepherd, than the jewelled
robes of eastern kings.&#8221;

<P>Then the star lifted his pale front from his
breast, and answered the archangel:

<P>&#8220;Lo!&#8221; he said, &#8220;ages have past, and each year
thou hast appointed me to the same ignoble charge.
Release me, I pray thee, from the duties that I
scorn; or, if thou wilt that the lowlier race of men
be my charge, give unto me the charge not of
many, but of one, and suffer me to breathe into
him the desire that spurns the valleys of life, and
ascends its steeps. If the humble are given to me,
let there be amongst them one whom I may lead
on the mission that shall abase the proud; for, behold,
O Appointer of the Stars, as I have sat for
uncounted years upon my solitary throne, brooding
over the things beneath, my spirit hath gathered
wisdom from the changes that shift below. Looking
upon the tribes of earth, I have seen how the
<!-- Page 8 -->
multitude are swayed, and tracked the steps that
lead weakness into power; and fain would I be
the ruler of one who, if abased, shall aspire to
rule.&#8221;

<P>As a sudden cloud over the face of noon was the
change on the brow of the archangel.

<P>&#8220;Proud and melancholy star,&#8221; said the herald,
&#8220;thy wish would war with the courses of the invisible
destiny, that, throned far above, sways and
harmonizes all; the source from which the lesser
rivers of fate are eternally gushing through the
heart of the universe of things. Thinkest thou
that thy wisdom, of itself, can lead the peasant to
become a king?&#8221;

<P>And the crowned star gazed undauntedly on the
face of the archangel, and answered:

<P>&#8220;Yea!&#8212;grant me but one trial!&#8221;

<P>Ere the archangel could reply, the farthest
centre of the heaven was rent as by a thunderbolt;
and the divine herald covered his face with his
hands, and a voice low and sweet, and mild with
the consciousness of unquestionable power, spoke
forth to the repining star:

<P>&#8220;The time has arrived when thou mayest have
thy wish. Below thee, upon yon solitary plain,
sits a mortal, gloomy as thyself, who, born under
thy influence, may be moulded to thy will.&#8221;

<P>The voice ceased, as the voice of a dream. Silence
was over the seas of space, and the archangel,
<!-- Page 9 -->
once more borne aloft, slowly soared away into the
farther heaven, to promulgate the divine bidding
to the stars of far-distant worlds.

<P>But the soul of the discontented star exulted
within itself; and it said, &#8220;I will call forth a king
from the valley of the herdsmen, that shall trample
on the kings subject to my fellows, and render the
charge of the contemned star more glorious than
the minions of its favored brethren; thus shall I
revenge neglect&#8212;thus shall I prove my claim
hereafter to the heritage of the great of earth!&#8221;
<BR><BR><BR>
<P>At that time, though the world had rolled on for
ages, and the pilgrimage of man had passed
through various states of existence, which our dim
traditionary knowledge has not preserved, yet the
condition of our race in the northern hemisphere
was then what <i>we</i>, in our imperfect lore, have conceived
to be among the earliest.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 1 -->
<!-- (These part divisions in comments are not part of the original book) -->
<P>
By a rude and vast pile of stones, the masonry
of arts forgotten, a lonely man sat at midnight,
gazing upon the heavens. A storm had just passed
from the earth&#8212;the clouds had rolled away, and
the high stars looked down upon the rapid waters of
the Rhine; and no sound save the roar of the waves
and the dripping of the rain from the mighty trees,
was heard around the ruined pile: the white sheep
lay scattered on the plain, and slumber with them.
He sat watching over the herd, lest the foes of a
neighboring tribe seized them unawares, and thus he
coummuned with himself:

<P>

  &#8220;The king sits upon his throne, and is honored
by a warrior race, and the warrior exults in the
trophies he has won; the step of the huntsman is
bold upon the mountain-top, and his name is sung
at night round the pine-fires, by the lips of the
bard; and the bard himself hath honor in the hail.
But I, who belong not to the race of kings, and
whose limbs can bound not to the rapture of war,
nor scale the eyries of the eagle and the haunts of
the swift stag; whose hand cannot string the harp,
and whose voice is harsh in the song; <i>I</i> have
neither honor nor command, and men bow not the
head as I pass along; yet do I feel within me the
consciousness of a great power that should rule my
species&#8212;not obey. My eye pierces the secret
hearts of men&#8212;I see their thoughts ere their lips
proclaim them; and I scorn, while I see, the
weakness and the vices which I never shared. I laugh
at the madness of the warrior&#8212;I mock within my
soul at the tyranny of kings. Surely there is
something in man&#8217;s nature more fitted to command&#8212;more
worthy of renoun, than the sinews of the arm,
or the swiftness of the feet, or the accident of
birth!&#8221;

<P>

  As Morven, the son of Osslah, thus mused within
himself, still looking at the heavens, the solitary
man beheld a star suddenly shooting from its place,
and speeding through the silent air, till it as
suddenly paused right over the midnight river, and
facing the inmate of the pile of stones.

<P>

  As he gazed upon the star strange thoughts
grew slowly over him. He drank, as it were, from
its solemn aspect, the spirit of a great design. A
dark cloud rapidly passing over the earth, snatched
the star from his sight; but left to his awakened
mind the thoughts and the dim scheme that had
come to him as he gazed.

<P>

   When the sun arose one of his brethren relieved
 him of his charge over the herd, and he went away,
 but not to his father&#8217;s home. Musingly he plunged
 into the dark and leafless recesses of the winter
 forest; and shaped out of his wild thoughts, more
 palpably and clearly, the outline of his daring hope.

<P>

   While thus absorbed, he heard a great noise in
the forest, and, fearful lest the hostile tribe of the
Alrich might pass that way, he ascended one of
the loftiest pine-trees, to whose perpetual verdure
the winter had not denied the shelter he sought,
and, concealed by its branches, he looked anxiously
forth in the direction whence the noise had proceed.

<P>

   And IT came&#8212;it came with a tramp and a crash,
and a crushing tread upon the crunched boughs
and matted leaves that strewed the soil&#8212;it came&#8212;it
came, the monster that the world now holds
no more&#8212;the mighty mammoth of the North!

<P>

  Slowly it moved in its huge strength along, and
its burning eyes glittered through the gloomy
shade: its jaws, falling apart, showed the grinders
with which it snapped asunder the young oaks of
the forest; and the vast tusks, which, curved
downward to the midst of its massive limbs, glistened
white and ghastly, curdling the blood of one
destined hereafter to be the dreaded ruler of the
men of that distant age.

<P>

   The livid eyes of the monster fastened on the
form of the herdsman, even amidst the thick darkness
of the pine. It paused&#8212;it glared upon him&#8212;its
jaws opened, and a low deep sound, as of gathering
thunder, seemed to the son of Osslah as the knell of
a dreadful grave. But after glaring on him for some
moments, it again, and calmly, pursued its terrible
way, crashing the boughs as it marched along, till
the last sound of its heavy tread died away upon
his ear.

<P>

  Ere yet, however, before Morven had summoned
the courage to descend the tree, he saw the shining
of arms through the bare branches of the wood,
and presently a small hand of the hostile Alrich
came into sight. He was perfectly hidden from
them; and, listening as they passed him, he heard
one say to another:

<P>

&#8220;The night covers all things; why attack them by day?&#8221;

<P>

  And he who seemed the chief of the band, answered
&#8220;Right. To-night, when they sleep in their
city, we will upon them. Lo! they will be drenched
in wine, and fall like sheep into our hands.&#8221;

<P>

    &#8220;But where, O chief,&#8221; said a third of the band,
shall our men hide during the day? for there are
many hunters among the youth of the Oestrich
tribe, and they might see us in the forest unawares,
and arm their race against our coming.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;I have prepared for that,&#8221; answered the chief.
&#8220;Is not the dark cavern of Oderlin at hand? Will
it not shelter us from the eyes of the victims?&#8221;

<P>

  Then the men laughed, and shouting, they
went their way adown the forest.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 2 -->
<P>
  When they were gone Morven cautiously descended,
and, striking into a broad path, hastened to a vale
that lay between the forest and the river in which
was the city where the chief of his country dwelt.

<P>

  As he passed by the warlike men, giants in that
day, who thronged the streets (if streets they
might be called), their half garments parting from
their huge limbs, the quiver at their backs, and
the hunting spears in their hands, they laughed
and shouted out, and, pointing to him, cried:

<P>

  &#8220;Morven, the woman! Morven, the cripple!
what dost thou among men?&#8221;

<P>

  For the son of Osslah was small in stature and
of slender strength, and his step had halted from
his birth; but he passed through the warriors
unheedingly.

<P>

  At the outskirts of the city he came upon a tail
pile, in which some old men dwelt by themselves,
and counseled the king when times of danger, or
when the failure of the season, the famine, or the
drought, perplexed the ruler, and clouded the
savage fronts of his warrior tribe.

<P>

  They gave the counsels of experience, and when
experience failed, they drew, in their believing
ignorance, assurances and omens from the winds
of heaven, the changes of the moon, and the flights
of the wandering birds. Filled (by the voices of
the elements, and the variety of mysteries which
ever shift along the face of things, unsolved by the
wonder which pauses not, the fear which believes,
and that eternal reasoning of all experience, which
assigns causes to effects) with the notion of superior
powers, <i>they assisted their ignorance by the
conjectures of their superstition</i>. But as yet
they knew no craft and practiced no <i>voluntary</i>
delusion; they trembled too much at the mysteries,
which had created their faith, to seek to belie
them. They counselled as they believed, and the bold
dream had never dared to cross men thus worn and
grey with age, of governing their warriors and their
kings by the wisdom of deceit.

<P>

  The son of Osslah entered the vast pile with a
fearless step, and approached the place at the
upper end of the hall, where the old men sat in
conclave.

<P>

  &#8220;How, base-torn and craven limbed!&#8221; cried the
eldest, who had been a noted warrior in his day;
&#8220;darest thou enter unsummoned amidst the secret
councils of the wise men? Knowest thou not,
scatterling! that the penalty is death?&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Slay me, if thou wilt,&#8221; answered Morven &#8220;but
hear!

<P>

  &#8220;As I sat last night in the ruined palace of our
ancient kings, tending, as my father bade me, the
sheep that grazed around, lest the fierce tribe of
Alrich should descend unseen from the mountains
upon the herd, a storm came darkly on; and when
the storm, had ceased and I looked above on the
sky, I saw a star descend from its height towards
me, and a voice from the star said, &#8216;Son of Osslah,
leave thy herd and seek the council of the wise
men, and say unto them, that they take thee as
one of their number, or that sudden will be the
destruction of them, and theirs.&#8217;

<P>

  &#8220;But I had courage to answer the voice, and I
said, &#8216;Mock not the poor son of the herdsman.
Behold they will kill me if I utter so rash a word,
for I am poor and valueless in the eyes of the tribe
of Oestrich, and the great in deeds and the grey of
hair alone sit in the council of the wise men.&#8217;

<P>

  &#8220;Then the voice said, &#8216;Do my bidding, and I
will give thee a token that thou comest from the
powers that sway the seasons and sail upon the
eagles of the winds. Say unto the wise men that
this very night if they refuse to receive thee of
their band, evil shall fall upon them, and the
morrow shall dawn in blood.&#8217;

<P>

  &#8220;Then the voice ceased, and a cloud passed over
the star; and I communed with myself, and came,
O dread fathers, mournfully unto you. For I
feared that ye would smite me because of my bold
tongue, and that ye would, sentence me to the
death, in that I asked what may scarce be given
even to the sons of kings.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the grim elders looked one at the other
and marvelled much, nor knew they what answer
they should make to the herdsman&#8217;s son.

<P>

  At length one of the wise men said, &#8220;Surely
there must be truth in the son of Osslah, for he
would not dare to falsify the great lights of heaven.
If he had given unto men the words of the star,
verily we might doubt the truth. But who would
brave the vengeance of the gods of night?&#8221;

<P>

  Then the elders shook their heads approvingly;
but one answered and said:

<P>

    &#8220;Shall we take the herdsman&#8217;s son as our equal?
No!&#8221;

<P>

  The name of the man who thus answered was
Darvan, and his words were pleasing to the elders.

<P>

  But Morven spoke out:

<P>

  &#8220;Of a truth, O councilors of kings! I look not
to be an equal with yourselves. Enough if I tend
the gates of your palace, and serve you as the son
of Osslah may serve;&#8221; and he bowed his head
humbly as he spoke.

<P>

  Then said the chief of the elders, for he was
wiser than the others, &#8220;But how wilt thou deliver
us from the evil that is to come? Doubtless the
star hath informed thee of the service thou canst
render to us if we take thee into our palace, as well
as the ill that will fall on us if we refuse.&#8221;

<P>

  Morven answered meekly: &#8220;Surely, if thou acceptest
thy servant, the star will teach him that which may
requite thee; but as yet he knows only what he has
uttered.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the sages bade him withdraw, and they
communed with themselves and they differed
much; but though fierce men and bold at the war
cry of a human foe, they shuddered at the prophecy
of a star. So they resolved to take the son of
Osslah, and suffer him to keep the gate of the
council-hall.

<P>

  He heard their decree and towed his head, and
went to the gate, and sat down by it in silence.

<P>

  And the sun went down in the west, and the
first stats of the twilight began to glimmer, when
Morven started front his seat, and a trembling
appeared to seize his limbs. His lips foamed; an
agony and a fear possessed him; he writhed as a
man whom the spear of a foeman has pierced with
a mortal wound, and suddenly fell upon his face
on the stony earth.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 3 -->
<P>
  The elders approached him; wondering, they
lifted him up. He slowly recovered as from a
swoon; his eyes rolled wildly.

<P>

  &#8220;Heard ye not the voice of the star?&#8221; he said.

<P>

  And the chief of the elders answered, &#8220;Nay, we
heard no sound.&#8221;

<P>

  Then Morven sighed heavily.

<P>

  &#8220;To me only the word was given. Summon
instantly, O councilors of the king! summon the
armed men, and all the youth of the tribe, and let
them take the sword and the spear, and follow thy
servant.  For lo! the star hath announced to him
that the foe shall fall into our hands as the wild
beast of the forests.&#8221;

<P>

  The son of Osslah spoke with the voice of command,
and the elders were amazed.

<P>

  &#8220;Why, pause ye?&#8221;  he cried. &#8220;Do the gods of
the night lie? On my head rest the peril if I
deceive ye.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the elders communed together; and they
went forth and summoned the men of arms, and
all the young of the tribe; and each man took the
sword and the spear, and Morven also. And the
son of Osslah walked first, still looking up at
the star; and he motioned them to be silent, and
move with a stealthy step.

<P>

  So they went through the thickest of the forest,
till they came to the mouth of a great cave,
overgrown with aged and matted trees, and it was
called the cave of Oderlin; and he bade the leaders
place the armed men on either side the cave, to the
right and to the left, among the hushes.

<P>

  So they watched silently till the night deepened,
when they heard a noise in the cave and the sound
of feet, and forth came an armed man; and the
spear of Morven pierced him, and be fell dead at
the month of the cave. Another and another, and
both fell! Then loud and long was heard the warcry
of Alrich, and forth poured, as a stream over a
narrow bed, the river of armed men.

<P>

  And the Sons of Oestrich fell upon them, and
the foe were sorely perplexed and terrified by the
suddenness of the battle and the darkness of the
night; and there was a great slaughter.

<P>

  And when the morning came, the children of
Oestrich counted the slain, and found the leader of
Alrich and the chief men of the tribe amongst
them, and great was the joy thereof.

<P>

  So they went back in triumph to the city, and
they carded the brave son of Osslah on their
shoulders, and shouted forth, &#8220;Glory to the servant
of the star.&#8221;

<P>

  And Morven dwelt in the council of the wise men.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 4 -->
  Now the king of the tribe had one daughter,
and she was stately amongst the women of the
tribe, and fair to look upon. And Morven gazed
upon her with the eyes of love, but he did not dare
to speak.

<P>

  Now the son of Osslah laughed secretly at the
foolishness of men; he loved them not, for they
had mocked him; he honored them not, for he had
blinded the wisest of their elders.

<P>

  He shunned their feasts and merriment and
lived apart and solitary.

<P>

  The austerity of his life increased the mysterious
homage which his commune with the stars had
won him, and the boldest of the warriors bowed
his head to the favorite of the gods.

<P>

  One day he was wandering by the side of the
river, and he saw a large bird of prey rise from the
earth, and give chase to a hawk that had not yet
gained the full strength of its wings. From his
youth the solitary Morven had loved to watch, in
the great forests and by the banks of the mighty
stream, the habits of the things which nature had
submitted to man; and looking now on the birds,
he said to himself, &#8220;Thus is it ever; by cunning
or by strength each thing wishes to master its
kind.&#8221;

<P>

  While thus, moralizing, the larger bird had
stricken down the hawk, and it fell terrified and
panting at his feet.

<P>

  Morven took the hawk in his hands, and the
vulture shrieked above him, wheeling nearer and
nearer to its protected prey; but Morven scared
away the vulture, and placing the hawk in his
bosom, he carried it home, and tended it carefully,
and fed it from his hand until it had regained its
strength; and the hawk knew him, and followed
him as a dog.

<P>

  And Morven said, smiling to himself, &#8220;Behold,
<i>the credulous fools around me put faith in the flight
and motions of birds</i>. I will teach this poor hawk
to minister to my ends.&#8221;

<P>

   So he tamed the bird, and tutored it according
to its nature; but he concealed it carefully from
others, and cherished it in secret.

<P>

   The king of the country was old and like to die,
and the eyes of the tribe were turned to his two
sons, nor knew they which was the worthier to
reign.

<P>

   And Morven passing through the forest one
evening, saw the younger of the two, who was a great
hunter, sitting mournfully under an oak, and looking
with musing eyes upon the ground.

<P>

   &#8220;Wherefore musest thou, O swift footed Siror?&#8221;
said the son of Osslah; &#8220;and wherefore art thou
sad?&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;Thou canst not assist me,&#8221; answered the
prince, sternly; &#8220;take thy way.&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;Nay,&#8221; answered Morven, &#8220;thou knowest not
what thou sayest; am I not the favorite of the
stars?&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Away, I am no graybeard whom the approach
of death makes doting: talk not to inc of the stars;
I know only the things that my eye sees and my
ear drinks in.&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;Hush,&#8221; said Morven, solemnly, and covering
his face; &#8220;hush! lest the heavens avenge thy
rashness. But, behold, the stars have given unto
me to pierce the secret hearts of others; and I can
tell thee the thoughts of thine.&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;Speak out, base-born!&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Thou art the younger of two, and thy name is
less known in war than the name of thy brother;
yet wouldst thou desire to be set over his head,
and to sit at the high seat of thy father?&#8221;

<P>

  The young man turned pale.

<P>

   &#8220;Thou hast truth in thy lips,&#8221; said he, with a
faltering voice.

<P>

  &#8220;Not from me, but from the stars, descends the
truth.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Can the stars grant my wish?&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;They can; let us meet to-morrow.&#8221; Thus saying,
Morven passed into the forest.

<P>

  The next day, at noon, they met again.

<P>

  &#8220;I have consulted the gods of night, and they
have given me the power that I prayed for, but on
one condition.&#8221;

<P>

&#8220;Name it.&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;That thou sacrifice thy sister on their altars
thou must build up a heap of stones, and take thy
sister into the wood, and lay her on the pile, and
plunge thy sword into her heart; so only shalt
then reign.&#8221;

<P>

  The prince shuddered, and started to his feet,
and shook his spear at the pale front of Morven.

<P>

  &#8220;Tremble,&#8221; said the son of Osslah, with a loud
voice. &#8220;Hark to the gods, who threaten thee with
death, that thou hast dared to lift thine arm against
their servant!&#8221;

<P>

  As he spoke, the thunder rolled above; for one
of the frequent storms of the early summer was
about to break.

<P>

  The spear dropped from the prince&#8217;s hand; he
sat down and cast his eyes on the ground.

<P>

   &#8220;Wilt thou do the bidding of the stars, and
reign?&#8221; said Morven.

<P>

  &#8220;I will!&#8221; cried Siror, with a desperate voice.

<P>

  &#8220;This evening, then, when the sun sets, thou
wilt lead her hither, alone; I may not attend thee.
Now, let us pile the stones.&#8221;

<P>

  Silently the huntsman bent his vast strength to
the fragments of rock that Morven pointed to him,
and they built the altar, and went their way.

<P><BR>

  And beautiful is the dying of the great sum
when the last song of the birds fades into the lap
of silence; when the islands of the cloud are
bathed in light, and the first star springs up over
the grave of day.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 5 -->
<P>
  &#8220;Whither leadest thou my steps, my brother?&#8221;
said Gina; &#8220;and why doth thy lip quiver? and
why dost thou tarn away thy face?&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Is not the forest beautiful; doth it not tempt
us forth, my sister?&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;And wherefore are those heaps of stone piled
together?&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Let others answer; <i>I</i> piled them not.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Thou tremblest brother: we will return.&#8221;

<P>

    &#8220;Not so; by those stones is a bird that my shaft
pierced to-day; a bird of beautiful plumage that I
slew for thee.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;We are by the pile: where hast thou laid the bird?&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;Here!&#8221; cried Siror; and he seized the maiden
in his arms, and, casting her on the rude altar, he
drew forth his sword to smite her to the heart.

<P>

   Right over the stones rose a giant oak, the
growth of immemorial ages; and from the oak, or
from the heavens; broke forth a loud and solemn
voice:

<P>


&#8220;Strike not, son of kings! the stars forbear
their own: the maiden thou shalt not slay; yet
shalt thou reign over the race of Oestrich; and
thou shall give Orna as a bride to the favorite of
the stars. Arise, and go thy way!&#8221;

<P>

  The voice ceased: the terror of Orna had
overpowered for a time the springs of life; and
Siror bore her home through the wood in his strong
arms.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 6 -->
<P>
  &#8220;Alas!&#8221; said Morven, when, at the next day, he
again met the aspiring prince; &#8220;alas! the stars
have ordained me a lot which my heart desires
not; for I, lonely of life, and crippled of shape, am
insensible to the fires of love; and ever, as thou
and thy tribe know, I have shunned the eyes of
women, for the maidens laughed at my halting step
and my sullen features; and so in my youth I
learned betimes to banish all thoughts of love.
But since they told me (as they declared to <i>thee</i>),
that only through that marriage, thou, O beloved
prince! canst obtain thy fatter&#8217;s plumed crown, I
yield me to their will.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;But,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;not until I am king
can I give thee my sister in marriage; for thou
knowest that my sire would smite me to the dust,
if I asked him to give the flower of our race to the
son of the herdsman Osslah.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Thou speakest the words of truth. Go home
and fear not: but, when thou art king, the sacrifice
must be made, and Orna mine. Alas! how can I
dare to lift my eyes to her! But so ordain the
dread kings of the night!&#8212;Who shall gainsay
their word?&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;The day that sees me king, sees Orna thine,&#8221;
answered the prince.

<P>

  Morven walked forth, as was his wont, alone;
and he said to himself, &#8220;the king is old, yet may
he live long between me and mine hope!&#8221; and he
began to cast in his mind how he might shorten
the time.

<P>

  Thus absorbed, he wandered on so unheedingly,
that night advanced, and he had lost his path
among the thick woods, and knew not how to regain
his home; so he lay down quietly beneath a tree, and
rested till day dawned.

<P>

  Then hunger came upon him and he searched
among the bushes for such simple roots as those
with which, for he was ever careless of food, he
was used to appease the cravings of nature.

<P>

  He found, among other more familiar herbs and
roots, a red berry of a sweetish taste, which he had
never observed before. He ate of it sparingly, and
had not proceeded far in the wood before he found
his eyes swim, and a deadly sickness come over
him. For several hours he lay convulsed on the
ground expecting death; but the gaunt spareness
of his frame, and his unvarying abstinence,
prevailed over the poison, and he recovered slowly,
and after great anguish: but he went with feeble
steps back to the spot where the berries grew, and,
plucking several, hid them in his bosom, and by
nightfall regained the city.

<P>

  The next day he went forth among his father&#8217;s
herds, and seizing a lamb, forced some of the
berries into its stomach, and the lamb, escaping,
ran away, and fell down dead. Then Morven took
some more of the berries and boiled them down,
and mixed the juice with wine, and he gave the
wine in secret to one of his father&#8217;s servants, and
the servant died.

<P>

  Then Morven sought the king, and coming into
his presence alone, he said unto him, &#8220;How fares
my lord?&#8221;

<P>

  The king sat on a couch, made of the skins of
wolves, and his eye was glassy and dim; but vast
were his aged limbs and huge was his stature, and
he had been taller by a head than the children of
men, and none living could bend the bow he had
bent in youth. Grey, gaunt and worn, as some
mighty bones that are dug at times from the bosom
of the earth&#8212;a relic of the strength of old.

<P>

  And the king said, faintly, and with a ghastly
laugh:

<P>

  &#8220;The men of my years fare ill. What avails
my strength? Better had I been born a cripple
like thee, so should I have had nothing to lament
in growing old.&#8221;

<P>

  The red flash passed over Morven&#8217;s brow; but
he bent humbly&#8212;

<P>

  &#8220;O king, what if I could give thee back thy
youth? What if I could restore to thee the vigor
which distinguished thee above the sons of men,
when the warriors of Alrich fell like grass before
thy sword?&#8221;

<P>

  Then the king uplifted his dull eyes, and he
said:

<P>

  &#8220;What meanest thou, son of Osslah? Surely I
hear much of thy great wisdom, and how thou
speakest nightly with the stars. Can the gods of
the night give unto thee the secret to make the
old young?&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Tempt them not by doubt,&#8221; said Morven, reverently.
&#8220;All things are possible to the rulers of
the dark hour; and, lo! the star that loves thy
servant spake to him at the dead of night, and
said, &#8216;Arise, and go unto the king; and tell him
that the stars honor the tribe of Oestrich, and
remember how the king bent his bow against the Sons
of Alrich; wherefore, look thou under the stone that
lies to the right of thy dwelling&#8212;even beside the
pine-tree, and thou shalt see a vessel of clay, and
in the vessel thou wilt find a sweet liquid, that
shall make the king thy master forget his age
forever.&#8217;

<P>

  &#8220;Therefore, my lord, when the morning rose I
went forth, and looked under the stone, and behold
the vessel of clay; and I have brought it hither to
my lord, the king.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Quick&#8212;slave&#8212;quick! that I may drink and
regain my youth!&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Nay, listen, O king! farther said the star to
me:

<P>

  &#8220;&#8216;It is only at night, when the stars have power,
that this their gift will avail; wherefore, the king
must wait till the hush of the midnight, when the
moon is high, and then may he mingle the liquid
with his wine.

<P>

  &#8220;&#8216;And he must reveal to none that he hath received
the gift from the hand of the servant of the stars.
For THEY do their work in secret, and when men
sleep; therefore they love not the babble of mouths,
and he who reveals their benefits shall surely
die.&#8217;&#8221;

<P>

    &#8220;Fear not,&#8221; said the king, grasping the vessel;
&#8220;none shall know: and, behold, I will rise on the
morrow; and my two sons&#8212;wrangling for my
crown&#8212;verily, I shall be younger than they!&#8221;

<P>

  Then the king laughed loud; and he scarcely
thanked the servant of the stars, neither did he
promise him reward: for the kings in those days
had little thought&#8212;save for themselves.

<P>

  And Morven said to him, &#8220;Shall I not attend
my lord? for without me, perchance, the drug
might fail of its effect.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Aye,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;rest here.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Nay,&#8221; replied Morven; &#8220;thy servants will marvel
and talk much, if they see the son of Osslah
sojourning in thy palace. So would the displeasure
of the gods of night perchance be incurred.
Suffer that the lesser door of the palace be unbarred,
so that at the night hour, when the moon
is midway in the heavens, I may steal unseen into
thy chamber, and mix the liquid with thy wine.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;So be it,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;Thou art wise
though thy limbs are crooked and curt; and the
stars might have chosen a taller man.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the king laughed again; and Morven
laughed too, but there was danger in the mirth of
the son of Osslah.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 7 -->
<P>
  The night had began to wane, and the inhabitants
of Oestrich were buried in deep sleep, when,
hark! a sharp voice was heard crying out in the
streets, &#8220;Woe, woe! Awake ye sons of Oestrich&#8212;woe!&#8221;

<P>

  Then forth, wild&#8212;haggard&#8212;alarmed&#8212;spear in
hand, rushed the giant sons of the rugged tribe,
and they saw a man on a height in the middle of
the city, shrieking, &#8220;Woe!&#8221; and it was Morven,
the son of Osslah!

<P>

  And he said unto them, as they gathered round
him, &#8220;Men and warriors, tremble as ye hear.

<P>

    &#8220;The star of the west hath spoken to me and
thus saith the star:

<P>

    &#8220;&#8216;Evil shall fall upon the kingly house of
Oestrich&#8212;yea, ere the morning dawns; wherefore,
go thou mourning into the streets, and wake the
inhabitants to woe!&#8217;

<P>

  &#8220;So I rose and did the bidding of the star.&#8221;

<P>

  And while Morven was yet speaking, a servant
of the king&#8217;s house ran up to the crowd, crying
loudly:

<P>

  &#8220;The king is dead!&#8221;

<P>

  So they went into the palace and found the king
stark upon his couch, and his huge limbs all
cramped and crippled by the pangs of death, and
his hands clenched as if in menace of a foe&#8212;the
foe of all living flesh!

<P>

  Then fear came on the gazers, and they looked
on Morven with a deeper awe than the boldest
warrior would have called forth: and they bore
him back to the council-hall of the wise men,
wailing and clashing their arms in woe, and
shouting, ever and anon:

<P>

  &#8220;<i>Honor to Morven, the prophet!</i>&#8221;

<P>

  And that was the first time the word PROPHET
was ever used in those countries.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 8 -->
<P>
  At noon, on the third day from the king&#8217;s death,
Siror sought Morven, and he said:

<P>

  &#8220;Lo, my father is no more, and the people meet
this evening at sunset to elect his successor, and
the warriors and the young men will surely choose
my brother, for he is more known in war. Fail
me not, therefore.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Peace, boy!&#8221; said Morven, sternly; &#8220;nor dare
to question the truth of the gods of night.&#8221;

<P>

  For Morven now began to presume on his power
among the people, and to speak as rulers speak,
even to the sons of kings.

<P>

  And the voice silenced the fiery Siror, nor dared
he to reply.

<P>

  &#8220;Behold,&#8221; said Morven, taking up a chaplet of
colored plumes, &#8220;wear this on thy head, and put
on a brave face&#8212;for the people like a hopeful spirit&#8212;and
go down with thy brother to the place where
the new king is to be chosen, and leave the rest to
the stars.

<P>

  &#8220;But, above all things, forget not that chaplet;
it has been blessed by the gods of night.&#8221;

<P>

  The prince took the chaplet and returned home.

<P>

  It was evening and the warriors and chiefs of
the tribe were assembled in the place where the
new king was to be elected.

<P>

  And the voices of the many favored Prince
Voltoch, the brother of Siror, for he had slain twelve
foeman with his spear; and verily, in those days,
that was a great virtue in a king.

<P>

  Suddenly there was a shout in the streets, and
the people cried out:

<P>

&#8220;Way for Morven, the prophet, the prophet!&#8221;

<P>

  For the people held the son of Osslah in even
greater respect than did the chiefs.

<P>

  Now, since he had become of note, Morven had
assumed a majesty of air which the son of the
herdsman knew not in his earlier days; and albeit
his stature was short, and his limbs halted, yet his
countenance was grave and high.

<P>

  He only of the tribe wore a garment that swept
the ground, and his head was bare, and his long
black hair descended to his girdle, and rarely was
change or human passion seen in his calm aspect.

<P>

  He feasted not, nor drank wine, nor was his
presence frequent in the streets.

<P>

  He laughed not, neither did he smile, save when
alone in the forest&#8212;and then he laughed at the
follies of his tribe.

<P>

  So he walked slowly through the crowd, neither
turning to the left nor to the right, as the crowd
gave way; and he supported his steps with a staff
of the knotted pine.

<P>

   And when he came to the place where the chiefs
were met, and the two princes stood in the centre,
he bade the people around him proclaim silence.

<P>

  Then mounting on a huge fragment of rock, he
thus spake to the multitude:

<P>

   &#8220;Princes, wantors and bards! ye, O council of
the wise men! and ye, O hunters of the forests,
and snarers of the fishes of the streams! harken to
Morven, the son of Osslah.

<P>

  &#8220;Ye know that I am lowly of race, and weak of
limb; but did I not give into your hands the tribe
of Alrich, and did ye not slay them in the dead of
night with a great slaughter?

<P>

   &#8220;Surely, ye must know that this of himself did
not the herdsman&#8217;s son; surely he was but the
agent of the bright gods that love the children of
Oestrich.

<P>

  &#8220;Three nights since, when slumber was on the
earth, was not my voice heard in the streets?

<P>

   &#8220;Did I not proclaim woe to the kingly house of
Oestrich? and verily the dark arm had fallen on
the bosom of the mighty, that is no more.

<P>

   &#8220;Could I have dreamed this thing merely in a
dream, or was I not as the voice of the bright gods
that watch over the tribes of Oestrich?

<P>

  &#8220;Wherefore, O men and chiefs! scorn not the
son of Osslah, but listen to his words; for are they
not the wisdom of the stars?

<P>

   &#8220;Behold, last night, I sat alone in the valley,
and the trees were hushed around, and not a breath
stirred; and I looked upon the star that councels
the son of Osslah; and I said:

<P>

  &#8220;&#8216;Dread conqueror of the cloud! thou that
bathest thy beauty in the streams and piercest the
pine-boughs with thy presence; behold thy servant
grieved because the mighty one hath passed away,
and many foes surround the houses of my brethren;
and it is well that they should have a king
valiant and prosperous in war, the cherished of
the stars.

<P>

    &#8220;&#8216;Wherefore, O star! as thou gavest into our
hands the warriors of Alrich, and didst warn us of
the fall of the oak of our tribe, wherefore, I pray
thee, give unto the people a token that they may
choose that king whom the gods of the night
prefer!&#8217;

<P>

    &#8220;Then a low voice sweeter than the music of
the bard, stole along the silence.

<P>

    &#8220;&#8216;Thy love for thy race is grateful to the stars
of night: go then, son of Osslah, and seek the
meeting of the chiefs and the people to choose a
king, and tell them not to scorn thee because thou
art slow to the chase and little known in war; for
the stars give thee wisdom as a recompense for all.

<P>

    &#8220;&#8216;Say unto the people that as the wise men of
the council shape their lessons by the flight of
birds, so by the flight of birds stall a token be
given unto them, and they shall choose their kings.

<P>

    &#8220;&#8216;For,&#8217; said, the star of right, &#8216;the birds are
children of the winds, they pass to and fro along
the ocean of the air, and visit the clouds that are
the warships of the gods.

<P>

  &#8220;&#8216;And their music is but broken melodies which
they gleam from the harps above.

<P>

  &#8220;&#8216;Are they not the messengers of the storm?

<P>

    &#8220;&#8216;Ere the stream chafes against the bank, and
the rain descends, know ye not, by the wail of
birds and their low circles over the earth, that the
tempest is at hand?

<P>

    &#8220;&#8216;Wherefore, wisely do ye deem that the children
of the air are the fit interpreters between the
sons of men and the lords of the world above.

<P>

  &#8220;&#8216;Say then to the people and the chiefs, that
they shall take, from among the doves that nest in
the roof of the palace, a white dove, and they shall
let it loose in the air, and verily the gods of the
night shall deem the dove as a prayer coming from
the people, and they shall send a messenger to
grant the prayer and give to the tribes of Oestrich
a king worthy of themselves.&#8217;

<P>

  &#8220;With that the star spoke no more.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the friends of Voltoch murmured among
themselves, and they said, &#8220;Shall this man dictate
to us who shall be king?&#8221;

<P>

  But the people and the warriors shouted:

<P>

  &#8220;Listen to the star; do we not give or deny
battle according as the bird flies&#8212;shall we not by
the same token choose him by whom the battle
should be led?&#8221;

<P>

   And the thing seemed natural to them, for it
was after the custom of the tribe.

<P>

   Then they took one of the doves that built in
the roof of the palace, and they bought it to the
spot where Morven stood, and he, looking up to
the stars and muttering to himself, released the
bird.

<P>

   There was a copse of trees a little distance from
the spot, and as the dove ascended, a hawk suddenly
rose from the copse and pursued the dove;
and the dove was terrified, and soared circling high
above the crowd, when, lo, the hawk, poising itself
one moment on its wings, swooped with a sudden
swoop, and, abandoning its prey, alighted on the
plumed head of Siror.

<P>

   &#8220;Behold,&#8221; cried Morven in a loud voice, &#8220;behold your
king!&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;Hail, all hail the king!&#8221; shouted the people.
&#8220;All hail the chosen of the stars!&#8221;

<P>

  Then Morven lifted his right hand, and the
hawk left the prince, and alighted on Morven&#8217;s
shoulder.

<P>

   &#8220;Bird of the gods!&#8221; said he, reverently, &#8220;hast
thou not a secret message for my ear?&#8221; Then
the hawk put its beak to Morven&#8217;s ear, and Morven
bowed his head submissively; and the hawk rested
with Morven from that moment and would not be
scared away.

<P>

  And Morven said:

<P>

  &#8220;The stars have sent me this bird, that, in the
day-time, when I see them not, we may never be
without a counsellor in distress.&#8221;

<P>

  So Siror was made king, and Maven the son of
Osslah was constrained by the king&#8217;s will to take
Orna for his wife; and the people and the chiefs
honored Morven, the prophet, above all the elders
of the tribe.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 9 -->
<P>
  One day Morven said unto himself, musing,
&#8220;Am I not already equal with the king? nay, is
not the king my servant? did I not place him over
the heads of his brothers? am I not, therefore,
more fit to reign than he is? shall I not push him
from his seat?

<P>

  &#8220;It is a troublesome and stormy office to reign
over the wild men of Oestrich, to feast in the
crowded hail, and to lead die warriors to the fray.

<P>

  &#8220;Surely, if I feasted not, neither went out to
war, they might say, &#8216;This is no king, but the cripple
Morven;&#8217; and some of the race of Siror might
slay me secretly.

<P>

  &#8220;But can I not be greater far than kings, and
continue to choose and govern them, living as now
at mine own ease?

<P>

  &#8220;<i>Verily, the stars shall give me a new palace, and
many subjects</i>.&#8221;

<P>

  Among the wise men was Darvan; and Morven
feared him, for his eye often sought the movements
of the son of Osslah.

<P>

  And Morven said &#8220;It were better to TRUST this
man than to BLIND, for surely I want a helpmate
and a friend.&#8221;

<P>

  So he said to the wise man as he sat alone watching
the setting sun:

<P>

  &#8220;It seemeth to me, O Darvan! I that we ought to
build a great pile in honor of the stars and the
pile should be more glorious than all the palaces of
the chiefs and the palaces of the king; for are not
the stars our masters?

<P>

  &#8220;And thou and I should be the chief dwellers in
this new palace, and we would serve the gods of
night, and fatten their altars with the choicest of
the herd, and the freshest of the fruits of the earth.&#8221;

<P>

  And Darvan said:

<P>

  &#8220;thou speakest as becomes the servant of the
stars. But will the people help to build the pile,
for they are a war-like race and they love not toil?&#8221;

<P>

  And Morven answered:

<P>

  &#8220;<i>Doubtless the stars will ordain the work to be
done. Fear not</i>.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;In truth thou art a wondrous man, thy words
ever come to pass, answered Darvan; &#8220;and I
wish thou wouldest teach me, friend, the language
of the stars.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;Assuredly if thou servest me thou shalt know,&#8221;
answered the proud Morven; and Darvan was
secretly wroth that the son of the herdsman should
command the service of an elder and a chief.
<P>
  And when Morven returned to his wife he found
her weeping much.

<P>

  Now she loved the son of Osslah with an exceeding
love, for he was not savage and fierce as the men
she had known, and she was proud of his fame among
the tribe; and he took her in his arms and kissed
her, and asked her why she wept.

<P>

  Then she told him that her brother, the king, had
visited her and had spoken bitter words of Morven.

<P>

  &#8220;He taketh from me the affection of my people,&#8221;
said Siror, &#8220;and blindeth them with lies. And
since he hath made me king, what if he take my
kingdom from me? Verily, a new tale of the stars
might undo the old.&#8221;

<P>

  And the king had ordered her to keep watch on
Morven&#8217;s secrecy, and to see whether truth was in
him when he boasted of his commune with the
Powers of Night.

<P>

  But Orna loved Morven better than Siror, therefore
she told her husband all.

<P>

  And Morven resented the king&#8217;s ingratitude,
and was troubled much, for a king is a powerful
foe; but tie comforted Orna, and bade her dissemble
and complain also of him to her brother, so that he
might confide to her unsuspectingly whatsoever he
might design against Morven.

<P>

  There was a cave by Morven&#8217;s house in which
he kept the sacred hawk, and wherein he secretly
trained and nurtured other birds against future
need, and the door of the cave was always barred.

<P>

  And one day he was thus engaged when he beheld a
chink in the wall, that he had never noted before,
and the sun came playfully in; and while he looked
he perceived the sunbeam was darkened, and presently
he saw a human face peering in through the chink.

<P>

  And Morven trembled, for he knew he had been
watched.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 10 -->
<P>

  Morven ran hastily from the cave, but the spy had
disappeared among the trees, and Morven went
straight to the chamber of Darvan and sat himself
down.
<P>
  Darvan did not return home till late, and he
started and turned pale when he saw Morven.

<P>

  But Morven greeted him as a brother, and bade
him to a feast, which, for the first time, he
purposed giving at the full of the moon, in honor
of the stars.

<P>

  And going out of Darvan&#8217;s chamber, he returned
to his wife, and bade her hair, and go at
the dawn of day to the king, her brother, and
complain bitterly of Morven&#8217;s treatment, and pluck
the black schemes from the breast of the king. &#8220;For
surely,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Darvan hath lied to thy brother,
and some evil awaits me that I would fain know.&#8221;

<P>

  So the next morning Orna sought the king,
and she said:

<P>

  &#8220;The herdsman&#8217;s son hath reviled me, and
spoken harsh words to me; stall I not be
avenged?&#8221;

<P>

  Then the king stamped his feet and shook his
mighty sword.

<P>

  &#8220;Surely thou shalt be avenged, for I have
learned from one of the elders that which convinceth
me that the man hath lied to the people,
and the base-born shall surely die.

<P>

  &#8220;Yea, the first time that he goeth alone into the
forest my brother and I will fall upon him and
smite him to the death.&#8221;

<P>

  And with this comfort Siror dismissed Orna.

<P>

  And Orna flung herself at the feet of her husband.

<P>

  &#8220;Fly now, O my beloved!&#8212;fly into the forests
afar from my brethren, or surely the sword of
Siror will end thy days.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the son of Osslab folded his arms, and
seemed buried in black thoughts; nor did he heed
the voice of Orna, until again and again she had
implored him to fly.

<P>

  &#8220;Fly!&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;Nay, I was doubting
what punishment the stars should pour down upon our
foe. Let warriors fly. Morven, the prophet, conquers
by arms mightier than the sword.&#8221;

<P>
  Nevertheless Morven was perplexed in his
mind, and knew not how to save himself from the
vengeance of the king.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 10 -->
<P>
  Now, while Morven was musing hopelessly, he heard
a roar of waters; and behold the river, for it was
now the end of autumn, had burst its bounds, and
was rushing along the valley to the houses of the
city.

<P>

  And now the men of the tribe, and the women,
and the children, came running, and with shrieks
to Morven&#8217;s house, crying:

<P>

  &#8220;Behold the river has burst upon us!&#8212;Save us,
O ruler of the stars!&#8221;

<P>

  Then the sudden thought broke upon Morven
and he resolved to risk his fate upon one desperate
scheme.

<P>

  And he came out from the house calm and sad,
and he said:

<P>

  &#8220;Ye know not what ye ask; I cannot save ye
from this peril: ye have brought it on yourselves.&#8221;

<P>

  And they cried: &#8220;How? O son of Osslah&#8212;we
are ignorant of our crime.&#8221;

<P>

  And he answered:

<P>

  &#8220;Go down to the king&#8217;s palace and wait before
it, and surely I will follow ye, and ye shall learn
wherefore ye have incurred this punishment from
the gods.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the crowd rolled murmuring back, as a
receding sea; and when it was gone from the
place, Morven went alone to the house of Darvan,
which was next his own: and Darvan was greatly
terrified, for he was of a great age, and had no
children, neither friends, and he feared that he
could not of himself escape the waters.

<P>

  And Morven said to him, soothingly:

<P>

  &#8220;Lo, the people love me, and I will see that
thou art saved for verily thou hast been friendly
to me, and done me much service with the king.&#8221;

<P>

  And as he thus spake, Morven opened the door
of the house and looked forth, and saw that they
were quite alone; then he seized the old man by
the throat, and ceased not his grip till he was
quite dead.

<P>

  And leaving the body of the elder on the floor,
Morven, stole from the house and shut the gate.

<P>

  And as he was going to his cave he mused a
little while, when, hearing the mighty roar of the
waves advancing, and afar off the shrieks of
women, he lifted up his head, and said proudly:

<P>

  &#8220;No! in this hour terror alone shall be my
slave; I will use no art save the power of my soul.&#8221;

<P>

  So, leaning on his pine staff, he strode down to
the palace.

<P>

  And it was now evening, and many of the men
held torches, that they might see each other&#8217;s faces
in the universal fear.

<P>

  Red flashed the quivering flames on the dark
robes and pale front of Morven; and he seemed
mightier than the rest, because his face alone was
calm amidst the tumult.

<P>

  And louder and hoarser came the roar of the
waters; and swift rusted the shades of night over
the hastening tide.

<P>

  And Morven said in a stern voice:

<P>

  &#8220;Where is the king; and wherefore is he absent
from his people in the hour of dread?&#8221;

<P>

  Then the gate of the palace opened; and, behold
Siror was sitting in the hall by the vast pine-fire
and his brother by his side, and his chiefs around
him: for they would not deign to come amongst the
crowd at the bidding of the herdsman&#8217;s son.

<P>

  Then Morven, standing upon a rock above the
heads of the people (the same rack whereon he
had proclaimed the king), thus spake:

<P>

  &#8220;Ye desired to know, O sons of Oestrich!
wherefore the river hath burst its bounds, and the
peril hath come upon you.

<P>

  &#8220;Learn then, that the stars resent as the foulest
of human crimes an insult to their servants and
delegates below.

<P>

  &#8220;Ye are all aware of the manner of life of
Morven, whom ye have surnamed the Prophet!

<P>

  &#8220;He harms not man or beast; he lives alone;
and, far from the wild joys of the warrior tribe, he
worships in awe and fear the Powers of Night!

<P>

  &#8220;So is he able to advise ye of the coming
danger&#8212;so is he able to save ye from the foe.
Thus are your huntsmen swift and your warriors
bold; and thus do your cattle bring forth their
young, and the earth its fruits.

<P>

  &#8220;What think ye, and what do ye ask to hear?

<P>

  &#8220;Listen, men of Oestrich!&#8212;they have laid
snares for my life; and there are amongst you
those who have whetted the sword against the
bosom that is only filled with love for you.

<P>

  &#8220;Therefore have the stern lords of heaven
loosened the chains of the river&#8212;therefore doth
this evil menace ye.

<P>

  &#8220;Neither will it pass away until they who dig
the pit for the servant of the stars are buried in
the same.&#8221;

<P>

  Then, by the red torches, the faces of the men
looked fierce and threatening; and ten thousand
voices shouted forth:

<P>

  &#8220;Name them who conspired against thy life, O
holy prophet! and surely they shall be torn limb
from limb.&#8221;

<P>

  And Morven turned aside, and they saw that he
wept bitterly; and he said:

<P>

  &#8220;Ye have asked me, and I have answered: but
now scarce will ye believe the foe that I have
provoked against me; and by the heavens themselves I
swear, that if my death would satisfy their fury,
nor bring down upon yourselves, and your children&#8217;s
children, the anger of the throned stars, gladly
would I give my bosom to the knife. Yes,&#8221; he cried,
lifting up his voice, and pointing his shadowy arm
towards the hall where the king sat by the
pine-fire&#8212;&#8221;yes, thou whom by my voice the stars
chose above thy brother&#8212;yes, Siror, the guilty one!
take thy sword, and come hither&#8212;strike, if thou
hast the heart to strike, the Prophet of the Gods!&#8221;

<P>

  The king started to his feet, and the crowd were
hushed in a shuddering silence.

<P>

  Morven resumed:

<P>

   &#8220;Know then, O men of Oestrich, that Siror and
Voltoch, his brother, and Darvan, the elder of the
wise men, have purposed to slay your prophet,
even at such hour as when alone he seeks the
shade of the forest to devise new benefits for you.
Let the king deny it, if he can!&#8221;

<P>

  Then Voltoch, of the giant limbs, strode forth
from the hall, and his spear quivered in his hand.

<P>

  &#8220;Rightly hast thou spoken, base son of my
father&#8217;s herdsman! and for thy sins shalt thou
surely die; for thou liest when thou speakest of
thy power with the stars, and thou laughest at the
folly of them who hear thee: wherefore put him to
death.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the chiefs in the hall clashed their arms,
and rushed forth to slay the son of Osslah.

<P>

  But he, stretching his unarmed hands on high,
exclaimed:

<P>

  &#8220;Hear him, O dread ones of the night&#8212;hark
how he blasphemeth.&#8221;

<P>

  Then the crowd took up the word, and cried:

<P>

  &#8220;He blasphemeth&#8212;he blasphemeth against the
prophet!&#8221;

<P>

  But the king and the chiefs who hated Morven,
because of his power with the people, rushed into
the crowd; and the crowd were irresolute, nor
knew they how to act, for never yet had they
rebelled against their chiefs, and they feared alike
the prophet and the king.

<P>

  And Siror cried:

<P>

  &#8220;Summon Darvan to us, for he bath watched
the steps of Morven, and he shall lift the veil from
my people&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;

<P>

  Then three of the swift of foot started forth to
the house of Darvan.

<P>

  And Morven cried out with a loud voice:

<P>

  &#8220;Hark! thus saith the star who, now riding
through yonder cloud breaks forth upon my eyes&#8212;&#8216;For
the lie that the elder hath uttered against
my servant, the curse of the stars shall fall upon
him.&#8217; Seek, and as ye find him, so may ye find
ever the foes of Morven and the gods.&#8221;

<P>

  A chill and an icy fear fell over the crowd, and
even the cheek of Siror grew pale; and Morven,
erect and dark above the waving torches, stood
motionless with folded arms.

<P>

  And hark&#8212;far and fast came on the war-steeds
of the wave&#8212;the people heard them marching to
the land, and tossing their white manes in the
roaring wind.

<P>

   &#8220;Lo, as ye listen,&#8221; said Morven, calmly, &#8220;the
river sweeps on. Haste, for the gods will have a
victim, be it your prophet or your king.&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;Slave!&#8221; shouted Siror, and his spear left his
hand, and far above the heads of the crowd sped
hissing beside the dark form of Morven, and rent
the trunk of the oak behind.

<P>

   Then the people, wroth at the danger of their
beloved seer, uttered a wild yell, and gathered
round him with brandished swords, facing their
chieftains and their king.

<P>

  But at that instant, ere the war had broken forth
among the tribe, the three warriors returned, and
they bore Darvan on their shoulders, and laid him
at the feet of the king, and they said tremblingly:

<P>

  &#8220;Thus found we the elder in the centre of his
own hall.&#8221;

<P>

  And the people saw that Darvan was a corpse,
and that the prediction of Morven was thus verified.

<P>

  &#8220;So perish the enemies of Morven and the
Stars!&#8221; cried the son of Osslah. And the people
echoed the cry.

<P>

  Then the fury of Siror was at its height, and
waving his sword above his head, he plunged into
the crowd:

<P>

  &#8220;Thy blood, base-born, or mine.&#8221;

<P>

  &#8220;So be it!&#8221; answered Morven, quailing not.
&#8220;People, smite the blasphemer. Hark how the
river pours down upon your children and your
hearths. On, on, or ye perish!&#8221;

<P>

  And Siror fell, pierced by five hundred spears.

<P>

  &#8220;Smite! smite!&#8221; cried Morven, as the chiefs of
the royal house gathered round the king.

<P>

  And the clash of swords, and the gleam of
spears, and the cries of the dying, and the yell of
the trampling people, mingled with the roar of the
elements, and the voices of the rushing wave.

<P>

  Three hundred of the chiefs perished that night
by the swords of their own tribe. And the last
cry of the victors was, &#8220;<i>Morven the prophet</i>&#8212;MORVEN THE
KING!&#8221;

<P>

  And the son of Osslah, seeing the waves now
spreading over the valley, led Orna his wife, and
the men of Oestrich, their women and their children,
to a high mount, where they waited the dawning sun.

<P>

  But Orna sat apart and wept bitterly, for her
brothers were no more, and her race had perished
from the earth.

<P>

  And Morven sought to comfort her in vain.

<P>

  When the morning rose, they saw that the river
had overspread the greater part of the city, and
now stayed its course among the hollows of the
vale.

<P>

  Then Morven said to the people: &#8220;The star kings
are avenged, and their wrath appeased. Tarry only
here until the water have melted into the crevices
of the soil.&#8221;

<P>

  And on the fourth day they returned to the
city, and no man dared to name another, save
Morven, as the king.

<!-- THE FALLEN STAR: Part 10 -->
<P>
  But Morven retired into his cave and mused
deeply; and then assembling the people, he gave
them new laws; and he made them build a mighty
temple in honor of the stars, and made them heap
within it all that the tribe held most precious.

<P>

  And he took unto him fifty children from the
most famous of the tribe; and he took also ten
from among the men who had served him best,
and he ordained that they should serve the stars
in the great temple: and Morven was their chief.

<P>

  And he put away the crown they pressed upon
him, and he chose from among the elders a new
king.

<P>

  And he ordained that henceforth the servants
only of the stars in the great temple should elect
the king and the rulers, and hold council, and
proclaim war: but he suffered the king to feast,
and to hunt, and to make merry in the banquet halls.

<P>

  And Morven built altars in the temple, and was
the first who, in the North, <i>sacrificed the beast and
the bird, and afterwards human flesh</i>, upon the
altars.

<P>

  And he drew auguries from the entrails of the
victim, and made schools for the science of the
prophet; and Morven&#8217;s piety was the wonder of
the tribe, in that he refused to be a king.

<P>

  And Morven, the high-priest, was <i>ten thousand
times mightier than the king</i>.

<P>

  He taught the people to till the ground, and to
sow the herb; and by his wisdom, and the valor
that his prophecies instilled into men, he conquered
all the neighboring tribes.

<P>

  And the sons of Oestrich spread themselves over
a mighty empire, and with them spread the name
and the laws of Morven.

<P>

  And in every province which he conquered, he
ordered them to build a temple to the stars.

<P>

  But a heavy sorrow fell upon the years of
Morven.

<P>

  The sister of Siror bowed down her head and
survived not long the slaughter of her race.

<P>

  And she left Morven childless.

<P>

  And he mourned bitterly and as one distraught,
for her only in the world had his heart the power
to love.

<P>

  And he sat down and covered his face, saying:

<P>

  &#8220;Lo: I have conquered and travailed; and
never before in the world did man conquer what I
have conquered.

<P>

  &#8220;Verily, the empire of the iron thews and the
giant limbs is no more; I have found a new power,
that henceforth shall sway the lands;&#8212;<i>the empire
of plotting brain and a commanding mind</i>.

<P>

  &#8220;But, behold, my fate is barren, and I feel already
that it will grow neither fruit nor tree as a
shelter to mine old age.

<P>

  &#8220;Desolate and lonely shall I pass away unto
my grave.

<P>

   &#8220;O Orna! my beautiful! my loved! none were
like unto thee, and to thy love do I owe my glory
and my life.

<P>

   &#8220;Would for thy sake, O sweet bird! that nestled
in the dark cavern of my heart&#8212;would for thy
sake that thy brethren had been spared, for verily
with my life would I have purchased thine.

<P>

   &#8220;Alas! only when I lost thee did I find that thy
love was dearer to me than the fear of others.&#8221;

<P>

  And Morven mourned night and day, and none
might comfort him.

<P>

  But from that time forth he gave himself solely
to the cares of his calling; and his nature and
his affections, and whatever there was left soft in
him, grew hard like stone; and he was a man
without love, <i>and he forbade love and marriage to
the priest</i>.

<P>

  Now, in his latter years, there arose OTHER
prophets; for the world had grown wiser even by
Morven&#8217;s wisdom, and some did say unto themselves:

<P>

  &#8220;Behold Morven, the herdsman&#8217;s son, is a king
of kings: this did the stars for their servant;
shall we not, therefore, be also servants to the
star?&#8221;

<P>

   And they wore black garments like Morven, and
went about prophesying of what the stars foretold
them.

<P>

  And Morven was exceeding wroth; for he, more
than other men, knew that the prophets lied;
wherefore he went forth against them with the
ministers of the temple, and he took them and
burned them by a slow fire: for thus said Morven
to the people:

<P>

   &#8220;<i>A true prophet hath honor, but I only am a true prophet!</i>&#8221;

<P>

   &#8220;To all false prophets there shall be surely death.&#8221;

<P>

  And the people applauded the piety of the son
of Osslah.

<P>

  And Morven educated the wisest of the children
in the mysteries of the temple, so that they grew
up to succeed him worthily.

<P>

  And he died full of years and honor; and they
carved his effigy on a mighty stone before the
temple, and the effigy endured for a thousand ages,
and whoso looked on it trembled; for the face was
calm with the calmness of unspeakable awe!

<P>

  And Morven was the first mortal of the North
that made <i>Religion the stepping stone to Power</i>.

<P>

  Of a surety Morven was a great man!

<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>It was the last night of the old year, and the
stars sat, each upon his ruby throne, and
watched with sleepless eyes upon the world. The
night was dark and troubled, the dread winds
were abroad, and fast and frequent hurried the
clouds beneath the thrones of the kings of night.
But ever and anon fiery meteors flashed along
the depths of heaven, and were again swallowed
up in the graves of darkness.

<P>And far below his brethren, and with a lurid
haze around his orb, sat the discontented star that
had watched over the hunters of the North.
And on the lowest abyss of space there was
spread a thick and mighty gloom, from which, as
from a caldron, rose columns of wreathing smoke;
and still, when the great winds rested for an instant
on their paths, voices of woe and laughter,
mingled with shrieks, were heard booming from
the abyss to the upper air.

<P>And now, in the middest night, a vast figure
rose slowly from the abyss, and its wings threw
blackness over the world. High upward to the
throne of the discontented star sailed the fearful
shape, and the star trembled on his throne when
the form stood before him face to face. And the
shape said: &#8220;Hail, brother!&#8212;all hail!&#8221;

<P>&#8220;I know thee not,&#8221; answered the star: &#8220;thou art
not the archangel that visitests the kings of night.&#8221;

<P>And the shape laughed loud. &#8220;I am the fallen
star of the morning.&#8212;I am Lucifer, thy brother.
Hast thou not, O sullen king, served me and
mine? and hast thou not wrested the earth from
thy Lord who sittest above and given it to me by
<i>darkening the souls of men with the religion of fear?</i>
Wherefore come, brother, come;&#8212;thou hast a
throne prepared beside my own in the fiery gloom.
Come.&#8212;The heavens are no more for thee.&#8221; Then
the star rose from his throne, and descended to
the side of Lucifer. For ever hath the spirit of
discontent had sympathy with the soul of pride.

<P>And slowly they sank down to the gulf of gloom.
It was the first night of the new year, and the
stars sat each on his ruby throne, and watched
with sleepless eyes upon the world. But sorrow
dimmed the bright faces of the kings of night, for
they mourned in silence and in fear for a fallen
brother.

<P>And the gates of the heaven of heavens flew
open with a golden sound, and the swift archangel
fled down on his silent wings; and the archangel
gave to each of the stars, as before, the message of
his Lord; and to each star was his appointed
charge.

<P>And when the heraldry seemed done, there came
a laugh from the abyss of gloom, and half way from
the gulf rose the lurid shape of Lucifer, the fiend.

<P>&#8220;Thou countest thy flock ill, O radiant shepherd.
Behold! one star is missing from the three
thousand and ten.&#8221;

<P>&#8220;Back to thy gulf, false Lucifer!&#8212;the throne
of thy brother hath been filled.&#8221;

<P>And lo! as the archangel spake, the stars beheld
a young and all lustrous stranger on the
throne of the erring star; and his face was so soft
to look upon, that the dimmest of human eyes
might have gazed upon its splendor unabashed;
but the dark fiend alone was dazzled by its lustre,
and, with a yell that shook the flaming pillars of
the universe, he plunged backwards into the gloom.

<P>Then, far and sweet from the arch unseen, came
forth the voice of God:

<P>&#8220;Behold! <i>on the throne of the discontented star
sits the star of hope; and he that breathed into mankind
the Religion of Fear hath a successor in him
who shall teach earth the Religion of Love.</i>&#8221;

<P>And evermore the Star of Fear dwells with Lucifer,
and the Star of Love keeps vigil in heaven.

<CENTER><H2>BY LORD BROUGHAM.</H2></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H1>DISSERTATION ON THE ORIGIN OF EVIL.</H1></CENTER>
<HR width=70 align=center>

<P>The question which has more than, any other
harassed metaphysical reasoners, but especially
theologians, and upon which it is probable
that no very satisfactory conclusion will ever be
reached by the human faculties, is the Origin and
Sufferance of Evil.

<P>Its existence being always assumed, philosophers
have formed various theories for explaining
it, but they have always drawn very different inferences from it.

<P>The ancient Epicureans argued against the existence
of the Deity, because they held that the
existence of Evil either proved him to be limited
in power or of a malignant nature; either of which
imperfections is inconsistent with the first notions
of a divine being.

<P>In this kind of reasoning they have been followed
both by the atheists and sceptics of later
times.

<P>Bayle regarded the subject of evil as one of the
great arsenals from whence his weapons were to
be chiefly drawn. None of the articles in his
<!-- Page 62 -->
famous Dictionary are more labored than those in
which he treats of this subject. <i>Monichian</i>, and
still more <i>Paulician</i>, almost assume the appearance
of formal treatises upon the question; and both
<i>Marchionite</i> and <i>Zoroaster</i> treat of the same subject.
All these articles are of considerable value;
they contain the greater part of the learning upon
the question; and they are distinguished by the
acuteness of reasoning which was the other characteristic
of their celebrated author.

<P>Those ancient philosophers who did not agree
with Epicurus in arguing from the existence of
evil against the existence of a providence that
superintended and influenced the destinies of the
world, were put to no little difficulty in accounting
for the fact which they did not deny, and yet
maintaining the power of a divine ruler. The
doctrine of a double principle, or of two divine beings
of opposite natures, one beneficent, the other
mischievous, was the solution which one class of
reasoners deemed satisfactory, and to which they
held themselves driven by the phenomena of the
universe.

<P>Others unable to deny, the existence of things
which men denominate evil, both physical and
moral, explain them in a different way. They
maintained that physical evil only obtains the
name from our imperfect and vicious or feeble dispositions;
that to a wise man there is no such
<!-- Page 63 -->
thing; that we may rise superior to all such
groveling notions as make us dread or repine at
any events which can befall the body; that pain,
sickness, loss of fortune or of reputation, exile,
death itself, are only accounted ills by a weak and
pampered mind; that if we find the world tiresome,
or woeful, or displeasing, we may at any
moment quit it; and that therefore we have no
right whatever to call any suffering connected
with existence on earth an evil, because almost all
sufferings can be borne by a patient and firm
mind; since if the situation we are placed in becomes
either intolerable, or upon the whole more
painful than agreeable, it is our own fault that we
remain in it.

<P>But these philosophers took a further view of
the question which especially applied to moral
evil. They considered that nothing could be more
groundless than to suppose that if there were no
evil there could be any good in the world; and
they illustrated this position by asking how we
could know anything of temperance, fortitude or
justice, unless there were such things as excess,
cowardice and injustice.

<P>These were the doctrines of the Stoics, from
whose sublime and impracticable philosophy they
seemed naturally enough to flow. Aulus Gellius
relates that the last-mentioned argument was expounded
by Chrysippus, in his work upon providence.
<!-- Page 64 -->
The answer given by Plutarch seems quite
sufficient: &#8220;As well might you say that Achilles
could not have a fine head of hair unless Thersites
had been bald; or that one man's limbs could not
be all sound if another had not the gout.&#8221;

<P>In truth, the Stoical doctrine proceeds upon the
assumption that all virtue is only the negative of
vice; and is as absurd, if indeed it be not the very
same absurdity, as the doctrine which should deny
the existence of affirmative or positive truths, resolving
them all into the opposite of negative
propositions. Indeed, if we even were to admit
this as an abstract position, the actual existence of
evil would still be unnecessary to the idea, and
still more to the existence, of good. For the conception
of evil, the bare idea of its possibility,
would be quite sufficient, and there would be no
occasion for a single example of it.

<P>The other doctrine, that of two opposite principles,
was embraced by most of the other sects, as
it should seem, at some period or other of their
inquiries. Plato himself, in his later works, was
clearly a supporter of the system; for he held that
there were at least two principles, a good and an
evil; to which he added a third, the moderator or
mediator between them.

<P>Whether this doctrine was, like many others,
imported into Greece from the East, or was the
natural growth of the schools, we cannot ascertain.
<!-- Page 65 -->
Certain it is that the Greeks themselves believed
it to have been taught by Zoroaster in Asia, at
least five centuries before the Trojan war; so that
it had an existence there long before the name of
philosophy was known in the western world.

<P>Zoroaster's doctrine agreed in every respect with
Plato's; for besides Oomazes, the good, and Arimanius,
the evil principle, he taught that there
was a third, or mediatory one, called Mithras.
That it never became any part of the popular belief
in Greece or Italy is quite clear. All the
polytheism of those countries recognized each of
the gods as authors alike of good and evil. Nor
did even the chief of the divinities, under whose
power the rest were placed, offer any exception to
the general rule; for Jupiter not only gave good
from one urn and ill from another, but he was
also, according to the barbarous mythology of
classical antiquity, himself a model at once of
human perfections and of human vices.

<P>After the light of the Christian religion had
made some way toward supplanting the ancient
polytheism, the doctrine of two principles was
broached; first by Marcion, who lived in the time
of Adrian and Antonius Pius, early in the second
century; and next by Manes, a hundred years
later. He was a Persian slave, who was brought
into Greece, where he taught this doctrine, since
known by his name, having learned it, as is said,
<!-- Page 66 -->
from Scythianus, an Arabian. The Manichean
doctrines, afterwards called also Paulician, from a
great teacher of them in the seventh century, were
like almost all the heresies in the primitive church,
soon mixed up with gross impurities of sacred
rites as well as extravagant absurdities of creed.

<P>The Manicheans were, probably as much on
this account as from the spirit of religious intolerance,
early the objects of severe persecution;
and the Code of Justinian itself denounces capital
punishment against any of the sect, if found within
the Roman dominions.

<P>It must be confessed that the theory of two
principles, when kept free from the absurdities
and impurities which were introduced into the
Manichean doctrine, is not unnaturally adopted by
men who have no aid from the light of revelation,<A NAME="S1" HREF="#R1"><FONT
SIZE=-1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></A>
and who are confounded by the appearance of a
world where evil and good are mixed together, or
seem to struggle with one another, sometimes the
one prevailing, and sometimes the other; and accordingly,
in all countries, in the most barbarous
nations, as well as among the most refined, we
find plain traces of reflecting men having been
driven to this solution of the difficulty.

<P>It seems upon a superficial view to be very
easily deducible from the phenomena; and as the
<! -- Page 67 -->
idea of infinite power, with which it is manifestly
inconsistent, does by no means so naturally present
itself to the mind, as long as only a very great
degree of power, a power which in comparison of
all human force may be termed infinite, is the attribute
with which the Deity is believed to be endued.
Manichean hypothesis is by no means so
easily refuted. That the power of the Deity was
supposed to have limits even in the systems of the
most enlightened heathens is unquestionable.
They, generally speaking, believed in the eternity
of matter, and conceived some of its qualities to be
so essentially necessary to its existence that no
divine agency could alter them. They ascribed
to the Deity a plastic power, a power not of creating
or annihilating, but only of moulding, disposing
and moving matter. So over mind they
generally give him the like power, considering it
as a kind of emanation from his own greater mind
or essence, and destined to be re-united with him
hereafter. Nay, over all the gods, and of superior
potency to any, they conceived fate to preside; an
overruling and paramount necessity, of which
they formed some dark conceptions, and to which
the chief of all the gods was supposed to submit.
It is, indeed, extremely difficult to state precisely
what the philosophic theory of theology was in
Greece and Rome, because the wide difference
between the esoteric and exoteric doctrines, between
<!-- Page 68 -->
the belief of the learned few and the popular
superstition, makes it very difficult to avoid
confounding the two, and lending to the former
some of the grosser errors with which the latter
abounded. Nevertheless, we may rely upon what
has been just stated, as conveying, generally
speaking, the opinion of philosophers, although
some sects certainly had a still more scanty
measure of belief.

<P>But we shall presently find that in the speculation
of the much more enlightened moderns, Christians
of course, errors of a like kind are to be
traced. They constantly argue the great question
of evil upon a latent assumption, that the power of
the Deity is restricted by some powers or qualities
inherent in matter; notions analogous to that of
faith are occasionally perceptible; not stated or
expanded indeed into propositions, but influencing
the course of the reasoning; while the belief of
infinite attributes is never kept steadily in view,
except when it is called in as requisite to refute
the Manichean doctrines. Some observers of the
controversy have indeed not scrupled to affirm
that those of whom we speak are really Manicheans
without knowing it; and build their systems
upon assumptions secretly borrowed from the
disciples of Zoroaster, without ever stating those
assumptions openly in the form of postulates or
definition.
<!-- Page 69 -->
<P>The refutation of the Manichean hypothesis is
extremely easy if we be permitted to assume that
both the principles which it supposes are either of
infinite power or of equal power. If they are of
infinite power, the supposition of their co-existence
involves a contradiction in terms; for the one
being in opposition to the other, the power of each
must be something taken from that of the other;
consequently neither can be of infinite power. If,
again, we only suppose both to be of equal power,
and always acting against each other, there could
be nothing whatever done, neither good or evil;
the universe would be at a standstill; or rather no
act of creation could ever have been performed,
and no existence could be conceived beyond that
of the two antagonistic principles.

<P>Archbishop Tillotson's argument, properly
speaking, amounts to this last proposition, and is
applicable to equal and opposite principles, although
he applies it to two beings, both infinitely
powerful and counteracting one another. When
he says they would tie up each other's bands, he
might apply this argument to such antagonistic
principles if only equal, although not infinitely
powerful. The hypothesis of their being both infinitely
powerful needs no such refutation; it is a
contradiction in terms. But it must be recollected
that the advocates of the Manichean doctrine endeavor
to guard themselves against the attack by
<!-- Page 70 -->
contending, that the conflict between the two
principles ends in a kind of compromise, so that
neither has it all his own way; there is a mixture
of evil admitted by the good principle, because
else the whole would beat a standstill; while there
is much good admitted by the evil principle, else
nothing, either good or evil, would be done. Another
answer is therefore required to this theory
than what Tillotson and his followers have given.

<P><i>First</i>, we must observe that this reasoning of
the Manicheans proceeds upon the analogy of what
we see in mortal contentions; where neither party
having the power to defeat the other, each is content
to yield a little to his adversary, and so, by
mutual concession, both are successful to some
extent, and both to some extent disappointed.
But in a speculation concerning the nature of the
Deity, there seems no place for such notions.

<P><i>Secondly</i>, the equality of power is not an arbitrary
assumption; it seems to follow from the existence
of the two opposing principles. For if they
are independent of one another as to existence,
which they must needs be, else one would immediately
destroy the other, so must they also, in
each particular instance, be independent of each
other, and also equal each to the other, else one
would have the mastery, and the influence of the
other could not be perceived. To say that in some
things the good principle prevails and in others
<!-- Page 71 -->
the evil, is really saying nothing more than that
good exists here and evil there. It does not
further the argument one step, nor give anything
like an explanation. For it must always be borne
in mind that the whole question respecting the
Origin of Evil proceeds upon the assumption of a
wise, benevolent and powerful Being having created
the world. The difficulty, and the only difficulty,
is, how to reconcile existing evil with such
a Being's attributes; and if the Manichean only
explains this by saying the good Being did what
is good, and another and evil Being did what is
bad in the universe, he really tells us nothing
more than the fact; he does not apply his explanation
to the difficulty; and he supposes the existence
of a second Deity gratuitously and to no kind
of purpose.

<P>But, <i>thirdly</i>, in whatever light we view the
hypothesis, it seems exposed to a similar objection,
namely, of explaining nothing in its application,
while it is wholly gratuitous in itself. It
assumes, of course, that creation was the act of
the good Being; and it also assumes that Being's
goodness to have been perfect, though his power
is limited. Then as he must have known the existence
of the evil principle and foreseen the certainty
of misery being occasioned by his existence,
why did he voluntarily create sentient beings, to
put them, in some respects at least, under the evil
<!-- Page 72 -->
one's power, and thus be exposed to suffering?
The good Being, according to this theory, is the
remote cause of the evil which is endured, because
but for his act of creation the evil Being could
have had, no subjects whereon to work mischief;
so that the hypothesis wholly fails in removing,
by more than one step, the difficulty which it was
invented to solve.

<P><i>Fourthly</i>, there is no advantage gained to the
argument by supposing two Beings, rather than
one Being of a mixed nature. The facts lead to
this supposition just as naturally as to the hypothesis
of two principles. The existence of the evil
Being is as much a detraction from the power of
the good one, as if we only at once suppose the
latter to be of limited power, and that he prefers
making and supporting creatures who suffer much
less than they enjoy, to making no creatures at
all. The supposition that he made them as happy
as he could, and that not being able to make them
less miserable, he yet perceived that upon the
whole their existence would occasion more happiness
than if they never had any being at all, will
just account for the phenomena as well as the
Manichean theory, and will as little as that theory
assume any malevolence in the power which created
and preserved the universe. If, however, it
be objected that this hypothesis leaves unexplained
the fetters upon the good Being's power,
<!-- Page 73 -->
the answer is obvious; it leaves those fetters not
at all less explained than the Manichean theory
does; for that theory gives no explanation of the
existence of a counteracting principle, and it assumes
both an antagonistic power, to limit the
Deity's power, and a malevolent principle to set
the antagonistic power in motion; whereas our
supposition assumes no malevolence at all, but
only a restraint upon the divine power.

<P><i>Fifthly</i>, this leads us to another and most formidable
objection. To conceive the eternal existence
of one Being infinite in power, &#8220;self-created
and creating all others,&#8221; is by no means impossible.
Indeed, as everything must have had a cause,
nothing we see being by possibility self-created,
we naturally mount from particulars to generals,
until finally we rise to the idea of a first cause,
uncreated, and self-existing, and eternal. If the
phenomena compels us to affix limits to his goodness,
we find it impossible to conceive limits to the
power of a creative, eternal, self-existing principle.
But even supposing we could form the conception
of such a Being having his power limited as well
as his goodness, still we can conceive no second
Being independent of him. This would necessarily
lead to the supposition of some third Being,
above and antecedent to both, and the creator of
both&#8212;the real first cause&#8212;and then the whole
question would be to solve over again,&#8212;Why
<!-- Page 74 -->
these two antagonistic Beings were suffered to exist
by the great Being of all?

<P>The Manichean doctrine, then, is exposed to
every objection to which a theory can be obnoxious.
It is gratuitous; it is inapplicable to the
facts; it supposes more causes than are necessary;
it fails to explain the phenomena, leaving the
difficulties exactly where it found them. Nevertheless,
such is the theory, how easily soever refuted
when openly avowed and explicitly stated,
which in various disguises appears to pervade the
explanations, given of the facts by most of the
other systems; nay, to form, secretly and unacknowledged,
their principal ground-work. For it
really makes very little difference in the matter
whether we are to account for evil by holding that
the Deity has created as much happiness as was
consistent with &#8220;the nature of things,&#8221; and has
taken every means of avoiding all evil except
&#8220;where it necessarily existed&#8221; or at once give
those limiting influences a separate and independent
existence, and call them by a name of their
own, which is the Manichean hypothesis.

<P>The most remarkable argument on this subject,
and the most distinguished both for its clear and
well ordered statement, and for the systematic
shape which it assumes, is that of Archbishop
King. It is the great text-book of those who study
this subject; and like the famous legal work of
<!-- Page 75 -->
Littleton, it has found an expounder yet abler and
more learned than the author himself. Bishop
Law's commentary is full of information, of reasoning
and of explication; nor can we easily find
anything valuable upon the subject which is not
contained in the volumes of that work. It will,
however, only require a slight examination of the
doctrines maintained by these learned and pious
men, to satisfy us that they all along either assume
the thing to be proved, or proceed upon suppositions
quite inconsistent with the infinite power
of the Deity&#8212;the only position which raises a
question, and which makes the difficulty that requires
to be solved.

<P>According to all the systems as well as this one,
evil is of two kinds&#8212;physical and moral. To the
former class belong all the sufferings to which
sentient beings are exposed from the qualities and
affections of matter independent of their own acts;
the latter class consists of the sufferings of whatever
kind which arise from their own conduct.
This division of the subject, however, is liable to
one serious objection; it comprehends under the
second head a class of evils which ought more
properly to be ranged under the first. Nor is this
a mere question of classification: it affects the
whole scope of the argument. The second of the
above-mentioned classes comprehends both the
physical evils which human agency causes, but
<!-- Page 76 -->
which it would have no power to cause unless the
qualities of matter were such as to produce pain,
privation and death; and also the moral evil of
guilt which may possibly exist independent of
material agency, but which, whether independent
or not upon that physical action, is quite separable
from it, residing wholly in the mind. Thus a
person who destroys the life of another produces
physical evil by means of the constitution of matter,
and moral evil is the source of his wicked
action. The true arrangement then is this: Physical
evil is that which depends on the constitution
of matter, or only is so far connected with the
constitution of mind as that the nature and existence
of a sentient being must be assumed in order
to its mischief being felt. And this physical evil
is of two kinds; that which originates in human
action, and that which is independent of human
action, befalling us from the unalterable course of
nature. Of the former class are the pains, privations
and destruction inflicted by men one upon
another; of the latter class are diseases, old age
and death. Moral evil consists in the crimes,
whether of commission or omission, which men are
guilty of&#8212;including under the latter head those
sufferings which we endure from ill-regulated
minds through want of fortitude or self-control.
It is clear that as far as the question of the origin
of evil is concerned, the first of these two classes,
<!-- Page 77 -->
physical evil, depends upon the properties of matter,
and the last upon those of mind. The second
as well as the first subdivision of the physical
class depends upon matter; because, however ill-disposed
the agent's mind may be, he could inflict
the mischief only in consequence of the constitution
of matter. Therefore, the Being, who created
matter enabled him to perpetrate the evil, even
admitting that this Being did not, by creating the
mind also give rise to the evil disposition; and
admitting that, as far as regards this disposition it
has the same origin with the evil of the second
class, or moral evil, the acts of a rational agent.

<P>It is quite true that many reasoners refuse to
allow any distinction between the evil produced
by natural causes and the evils caused by rational
agents, whether as regards their own guilt, or the
mischief it caused to others. Those reasoners
deny that the creation of man's will and the endowing
it with liberty explains anything; they
hold that the creation of a mind whose will is to
do evil, amounts to the same thing, and belongs
to the same class, with the creation of matter
whose nature is to give pain and misery. But this
position, which involves the doctrine of necessity,
must, at the very least, admit of one modification.
Where no human agency whatever is interposed,
and the calamity comes without any one being to
blame for it, the mischief seems a step, and a
<!-- Page 78 -->
large step, nearer the creative or the superintending
cause, because it is, as far as men go, altogether
inevitable. The main tendency of the argument,
therefore, is confined to physical evil; and this
has always been found the most difficult to account
for, that is to reconcile with the government
of a perfectly good and powerful Being. It would
indeed be very easily explained, and the reconcilement
would be readily made, if we were at
liberty to suppose matter independent in its existence,
and in certain qualities, of the divine control;
but this would be to suppose the Deity's
power limited and imperfect, which is just one
horn of the Epicurean dilemma, &#8220;<i>Aut vult et non
potest;</i>&#8221; and in assuming this, we do not so much
beg the question as wholly give it up and admit
we cannot solve the difficulty. Yet obvious as this
is, we shall presently see that the reasoners who
have undertaken the solution, and especially King
and Law, under such phrases as &#8220;the nature of
things,&#8221; and &#8220;the laws of the material universe,&#8221;
have been constantly, through the whole argument,
guilty of this <i>petitio principii</i> (begging the
question), or rather this abandonment of the whole
question, and never more so than at the very moment
when they complacently plumed themselves
upon having overcome the difficulty.

<P>Having premised these observations for the purpose
of clearing the ground and avoiding confusion
<!-- Page 79 -->
in the argument, we may now consider that Archbishop
King's theory is in both its parts; for there
are in truth two distinct explanations, the one resembling
an argument <i>a priori</i>, the other an argument
<i>a posteriori</i>. It is, however, not a little
remarkable that Bishop Law, in the admirable abstract
or analysis which he gives of the Archbishop's
treatise at the end of his preface, begins
with the second branch, omitting all mention of
the first, as if he considered it to be merely introductory
matter; and yet his fourteenth note (t.
cap. <SPAN CLASS=smallcaps>i.</SPAN> s. 3.) shows that he was aware of its being
an argument wholly independent of the rest of the
reasonings; for he there says that the author had
given one demonstration <i>a priori</i>, and that no
difficulties raised by an examination of the phenomena,
no objection <i>a posteriori</i>, ought to overrule
it, unless these difficulties are equally certain
and clear with the demonstration, and admit of no
solution consistent with that demonstration.

<P>The necessity of a first cause being shown, and
it being evident that therefore this cause is uncreated
and self-existent, and independent of any
other, the conclusion is next drawn that its power
must be infinite. This is shown by the consideration
that there is no other antecedent cause, and
no other principle which was not created by the
first cause, and consequently which was not of inferior
power; therefore, there is nothing which
<!-- Page 80 -->
can limit the power of the first cause; and there
being no limiter or restrainer, there can be no
limitation or restriction.

<P>Again, the infinity of the Deity's power is attempted
to be proved in another way.

<P>The number of possible things is infinite; but
every possibility implies a power to do the possible
thing; and as one possible thing implies a power
to do it, an infinite number of possible things implies
an infinite power. Or as Descartes and his
followers put it, we can have no idea of anything
that has not either an actual or a possible existence;
but we have an idea of a Being of infinite
perfection; therefore, he must actually exist; for
otherwise there would be one perfection wanting,
and so he would not be infinite, which he either is
actually or possibly. It is needless to remark that
this whole argument, whatever may be said of the
former one, is a pure fallacy, and a <i>petitio principii</i>
throughout. The Cartesian form of it is the most
glaringly fallacious, and indeed exposes itself; for
by that reasoning we might prove the existence of
a fiery dragon or any other phantom of the brain.
But even King's more concealed sophism is equally
absurd. What ground is there for saying that
the number of possible things is infinite? He
adds, &#8220;at least in power,&#8221; which means either
nothing or only that we have the power of conceiving
an infinite number of possibilities. But
<!-- Page 81 -->
because we can conceive or fancy an infinity of
possibilities, does it follow that there actually exists
this infinity? The whole argument is unworthy
of a moment's consideration. The other is
more plausible, that restriction implies a restraining
power. But even this is not satisfactory when
closely examined. For although the first cause
must be self-existent and of eternal duration, we
only are driven by the necessity of supposing a
cause whereon all the argument rests, to suppose
one capable of causing all that actually exists;
and, therefore, to extend this inference and suppose
that the cause is of infinite power seems gratuitous.
Nor is it necessary to suppose another
power limiting its efficacy, if we do not find it
necessary to suppose its own constitution and essence
such as we term infinitely powerful. However,
after noticing this manifest defect in the
fundamental part of the argument, that which infers
infinite power, let us for the present assume
the position to be proved either by these or by any
other reasons, and see if the structure raised upon
it is such as can stand the test of examination.

<P>Thus, then, an infinitely powerful Being exists,
and he was the creator of the universe; but to incline
him towards the creation there could be no
possible motive of happiness to himself, and he
must, says King, have either sought his own
happiness or that of the universe which he made.
<!-- Page 82 -->
Therefore his own ideas must have been the communication
of happiness to the creature. He
could only desire to exercise his attributes without,
or eternally to himself, which before creating
other beings he could not do. But this could only
gratify his nature, which wants nothing, being
perfect in itself, by communicating his goodness
and providing for the happiness of other sentient
beings created by him for this purpose. Therefore,
says King, &#8220;it manifestly follows that the
world is as well as it could be made by infinite
power and goodness; for since the exercise of the
divine power and the communication of his goodness
are the ends, for which the world is formed,
there is no doubt but God has attained these ends.&#8221;
And again, &#8220;If then anything inconvenient or incommodious
be now, or was from the beginning in
it, that certainly could not be hindered or removed
even by infinite power, wisdom and goodness.&#8221;

<P>Now certainly no one can deny, that if God be
infinitely powerful and also infinitely good, it must
follow that whatever looks like evil, either is not
really evil, or that it is such as infinite power could
not avoid. This is implied in the very terms of
the hypothesis. It may also be admitted that if
the Deity's only object in his dispensation be the
happiness of his creatures, the same conclusion
follows even without assuming his nature to be
infinitely good; for we admit what, for the purpose
<!-- Page 83 -->
of the argument, is the same thing, namely, that
there entered no evil into his design in creating
or maintaining the universe. But all this really
assumes the very thing to be proved. King gets
over the difficulty and reaches his conclusion by
saying, &#8220;The Deity could have only one of two
objects&#8212;his own happiness or that of his creatures.&#8221;&#8212;The
skeptic makes answer, &#8220;He might
have another object, namely, the misery of his
creatures;&#8221; and then the whole question is,
whether or not he had this other object; or, which
is the same thing, whether or not his nature is
perfectly good. It must never be forgotten that
unless evil exists there is nothing to dispute
about&#8212;the question falls. The whole difficulty
arises from the admission that evil exists, or what
we call evil, exists. From this we inquire whether
or not the author of it can be perfectly benevolent?
or if he be, with what view he has created it?
This assumes him to be infinitely powerful, or at
least powerful enough to have prevented the evil;
but indeed we are now arguing with the Archbishop
on the supposition that he has proved the
Deity to be of infinite power. The skeptic rests
upon his dilemma, and either alternative, limited
power or limited goodness, satisfies him.

<p>It is quite plain, therefore, that King has assumed
the thing to be proved in his first argument,
or argument <i>a priori</i>. For he proceeds upon
<!-- Page 84 -->
the postulates that the Deity is infinitely good,
and that he only had human happiness in view
when he made the world.  Either supposition
would have served his purpose; and making either
would have been taking for granted the whole
matter in dispute. But he has assumed both; and
it must be added, he has made his assumption of
both as if he was only laying down a single position.
This part of the work is certainly more
slovenly than the rest. It is the third section of
the first chapter.

<P>It is certainly not from any reluctance to admit
the existence of evil that the learned author and
his able commentator have been led into this inconclusive
course of reasoning. We shall nowhere
find more striking expositions of the state
of things in this respect, nor more gloomy descriptions
of our condition, than in their celebrated
work. &#8220;Whence so many, inaccuracies,&#8221; says the
Archbishop, &#8220;in the work of a most good and
powerful God? Whence that perpetual war between
the very elements, between animals, between
men? Whence errors, miseries and vices, the
constant companions of human life from its infancy?
Whence good to evil men, evil to the
good? If we behold anything irregular in the
work of men, if any machine serves not the end it
was made for, if we find something in it repugnant
to itself or others, we attribute that to the
<!-- Page 85 -->
ignorance, impatience or malice of the workman.
But since these qualities have no place in God,
how come they to have place in anything? Or
why does God suffer his works to be deformed by
them?&#8221;&#8212;Chap. ii. s. 3. Bishop Law, in his admirable
preface, still more cogently puts the case:
&#8220;When I inquire how I got into the world, and
came to be what I am, I am told that an absolutely
perfect being produced me out of nothing, and
placed me here on purpose to communicate some
part of his happiness to me, and to make me in
some manner like himself. This end is not obtained&#8212;the
direct contrary appears&#8212;I find myself
surrounded with nothing but perplexity, want
and misery&#8212;by whose fault I know not&#8212;how to
better myself I cannot tell. What notions of good
and goodness can this afford me? What ideas of
religion? What hopes of a future state? For if
God's aim in producing me be entirely unknown,
if it be either his glory (as some will have it),
which my present state is far from advancing, nor
mine own good, which the same is equally inconsistent
with, how know I what I have to do here,
or indeed in what manner I must endeavor to
please him? Or why should I endeavor it at all?
For if I must be miserable in this world, what
security have I that I shall not be so in another
too (if there be one), since if it were the will of
my Almighty Creator, I might (for aught I see)
<!-- Page 86 -->
have been happy in both.&#8221;&#8212;Pref. viii. The question
thus is stated. The difficulty is raised in its
full and formidable magnitude by both these
learned and able men; that they have signally
failed to lay it by the argument <i>a priori</i> is plain.
Indeed, it seems wholly impossible ever to answer
by an argument <i>a priori</i> any objection whatever
which arises altogether out of the facts made
known to us by experience alone, and which are
therefore in the nature of contingent truths, resting
upon contingent evidence, while all demonstrations
<i>a priori</i> must necessarily proceed upon
mathematical truths. Let us now see if their
labors have been more successful in applying to
the solution of the difficulty the reasoning <i>a
posteriori.</i>

<P>Archbishop King divides evil into three kinds&#8212;imperfection,
natural evil and moral evil&#8212;including
under the last head all the physical evils
that arise from human actions, as well as the evils
which consists in the guilt of those actions.

<P>The existence of imperfection is stated to be
necessary, because everything which is created
and not self-existent must be imperfect; consequently
every work of the Deity, in other words,
everything but the Deity himself, must have imperfection
in its nature. Nor is the existence of
some beings which are imperfect any interference
with the attributes of others. Nor the existence
<!-- Page 87 -->
of beings with many imperfections any interference
with others having pre-eminence. The goodness
of the Deity therefore is not impugned by
the existence of various orders of created beings
more or less approaching to perfection. His creating
none at all would have left the universe less
admirable and containing less happiness than it
now does. Therefore, the act of mere benevolence
which called those various orders into existence is
not impeached in respect of goodness any more
than of power by the variety of the attributes
possessed by the different beings created.

<P>He now proceeds to grapple with the real difficulty
of the question. And it is truly astonishing
to find this acute metaphysician begin with an assumption
which entirely begs that question. As
imperfection, says he, arises from created beings
having been made out of nothing, so natural evils
arise &#8220;from all natural things having a relation to
matter, and on this account being necessarily
subject to natural evil.&#8221; As long as matter is
subject to motion, it must be the subject of generation
and corruption. &#8220;These and all other natural
evils,&#8221; says the author, &#8220;are so necessarily connected
with the material origin of things that they
cannot be separated from it, and thus the structure
of the world either ought not to have been formed
at all, or these evils must have been tolerated
without any imputation on the divine power and
<!-- Page 88 -->
goodness.&#8221; Again, he says, &#8220;corruption could
not be avoided without violence done to the laws
of motion and the nature of matter.&#8221; Again, &#8220;All
manner of inconveniences could not be avoided
because of the imperfection of matter and the nature
of motion. That state of things were therefore
preferable which was attained with the fewest and
the least inconveniences.&#8221; Then follows a kind
of menace, &#8220;And who but a very rash, indiscreet
person will affirm that God has not made choice
of this?&#8221;&#8212;when every one must perceive that
the bare propounding of the question concerning
evil calls upon us to exercise this temerity and
commit this indiscretion.&#8212;Chap. iv. s. <SPAN CLASS=smallcaps>i</SPAN>, div.
7.
He then goes into more detail as to particular
cases of natural evil; but all are handled in the
same way. Thus death is explained by saying
that the bodies of animals are a kind of vessels
which contain fluids in motion, and being broken,
the fluids are spilt and the motions cease; &#8220;because
by the native imperfection of matter it is
capable of dissolution, and the spilling and stagnation
must necessarily follow, and with it animal
life must cease.&#8221;&#8212;Chap. iv. s. 3. Disease is dealt
with in like manner. &#8220;It could not be avoided
unless animals had been made of a quite different
frame and constitution.&#8221;&#8212;Chap. iv. s. 7. The
whole reasoning is summed up in the concluding
section of this part, where the author somewhat
<!-- Page 89 -->
triumphantly says, &#8220;The difficult question then,
whence comes evil? is not unanswerable. For it
arises from the very nature and constitution of
created beings, and could not be avoided without
a contradiction.&#8221;&#8212;Chap. iv. s. 9. To this the
commentary of Bishop Law adds (Note 4<SPAN CLASS=smallcaps>i</SPAN>), &#8220;that
natural evil has been shown to be, in every case,
unavoidable, without introducing into the system
a greater evil.&#8221;

<P>It is certain that many persons, led away by the
authority of a great name, have been accustomed
to regard this work as a text-book, and have appealed
to Archbishop King and his learned commentator
as having solved the question. So many
men have referred to the <i>Principia</i> as showing the
motions of the heavenly bodies, who never read, or
indeed could read, a page of that immortal work.
But no man ever did open it who could read it and
find himself disappointed in any one particular;
the whole demonstration is perfect; not a link is
wanting; nothing is assumed. How different the
case here! We open the work of the prelate and
find it from the first to last a chain of gratuitous
assumptions, and, of the main point, nothing
whatever is either proved or explained. Evil
arises, he says, from the nature of matter. Who
doubts it? But is not the whole question why
matter was created with such properties as of
necessity to produce evil? It was impossible, says
<!-- Page 90 -->
he, to avoid it consistently with the laws of motion
and matter. Unquestionably; but the whole dispute
is upon those laws. If indeed the laws of
nature, the existing constitution of the material
world, were assumed as necessary, and as binding
upon the Deity, how is it possible that any question
ever could have been raised? The Deity
having the power to make those laws, to endow
matter with that constitution, and having also the
power to make different laws and to give matter
another constitution, the whole question is, how
his choosing to create the present existing order of
things&#8212;the laws and the constitution which we
find to prevail&#8212;can be reconciled with perfect
goodness. The whole argument of the Archbishop
assumes that matter and its laws are independent
of the Deity; and the only conclusion to which
the inquiry leads us is that the Creator has made
a world with as little of evil in it as the nature of
things,&#8212;that is, as the laws of nature and matter&#8212;allowed
him; which is nonsense, if those laws
were made by him, and leaves the question where
it was, or rather solves it by giving up the omnipotence
of the Creator, if these laws were binding
upon him.

<P>It must be added, however, that Dr. King and
Dr. Law are not singular in pursuing this most
inconclusive course of reasoning.

<P>Thus Dr. J. Clarke, in his treatise on natural
<!-- Page 91 -->
evil, quoted by Bishop Law (Note 32), shows how
mischiefs arise from the laws of matter; and says
this could not be avoided &#8220;without altering those
primary laws, i. e., making it something else than
what it is, or changing it into another form; the
result of which would only be to render it liable
to evils of another kind against which the same
objections would equally lie.&#8221; So Dr. J. Burnett,
in his discourses on evil, at the Boyle Lecture
(vol. ii. P. 201), conceives that he explains death
by saying that the materials of which the body is
composed &#8220;cannot last beyond seventy years, or
thereabouts, and it was originally intended that
we should die at that age.&#8221; Pain, too, he imagines
is accounted for by observing that we are endowed
with feelings, and that if we could not feel pain, so
neither could we pleasure (p. 202). Again, he
says that there are certain qualities which &#8220;in the
nature of things matter is incapable of&#8221; (p. 207).
And as if he really felt the pressure of this difficulty,
be at length comes to this conclusion, that
life is a free gift, which we had no right to exact,
and which the Deity lay under no necessity to
grant, and therefore we must take it with the conditions
annexed (p. 210); which is undeniably
true, but is excluding the discussion and not answering
the question proposed. Nor must it be
forgotten that some reasoners deal strangely with
the facts. Thus Derham, in his <i>Physico-Theology</i>,
<!-- Page 92 -->
explaining the use of poison in snakes, first desires
us to bear in mind that many venomous ones
are of use medicinally in stubborn diseases, which
is not true, and if it were, would prove nothing,
unless the venom, not the flesh, were proved to be
medicinal; and then says, they are &#8220;scourges
upon ungrateful and sinful men;&#8221; adding the
truly astounding absurdity, &#8220;that the nations
which know not God are the most annoyed with
noxious reptiles and other pernicious creatures.&#8221;
(Book ix. c. <SPAN CLASS=smallcaps>i</SPAN>); which if it were true would raise
a double difficulty, by showing that one people was
scourged because another had neglected to preach
the gospel among them. Dr. J. Burnett, too, accounts
for animals being suffered to be killed as
food for man, by affirming that they thereby gain
all the care which man is thus led to bestow upon
them, and so are, on the whole, the better for
being eaten. (Boyle Lecture, II. 207). But the
most singular error has perhaps been fallen into
by Dr. Sherlock, and the most, unhappy&#8212;which
yet Bishop Law has cited as a sufficient answer to
the objection respecting death: &#8220;It is a great instrument
of government, and makes men afraid of
committing such villanies as the laws of their
country have made capital.&#8221; (Note 34). So that
the greatest error in the criminal legislation of all
countries forms part of the divine providence, and
man has at length discovered, by the light of reason,
<!-- Page 93 -->
the folly and the wickedness of using an instrument
expressly created by divine Omniscience
to be abused!

<P>The remaining portion of King's work, filling
the second volume of Bishop Law's edition, is devoted
to the explanation of Moral Evil; and here
the gratuitous assumption of the &#8220;nature of
things,&#8221; and the &#8220;laws of nature,&#8221; more or less
pervade the whole as in the former parts of the
Inquiry.

<P>The fundamental position of the whole is, that
man having been endowed with free will, his
happiness consists in making due elections, or in
the right exercise of that free will. Five causes
are then given of undue elections, in which of
course his misery consists as far as that depends
on himself; these causes are error, negligence,
over-indulgence of free choice, obstinacy or bad
habit, and the importunity of natural appetites;
which last, it must in passing be remarked, belongs
to the head of physical evil, and cannot be
assumed in this discussion without begging the
question. The great difficulty is then stated and
grappled with, namely, how to reconcile these
undue elections with divine goodness. The objector
states that free will might exist without the
power of making undue elections, he being suffered
to range, as it were, only among lawful objects of
choice. But the answer to this seems sound, that
<!-- Page 94 -->
such a will would only be free in name; it would
be free to choose among certain things, but would
not be free-will. The objector again urges, that
either the choice is free and may fall upon evil
objects, against the goodness of God, or it is so
restrained as only to fall on good objects. Against
freedom of the will King's solution is, that more
evil would result from preventing these undue
elections than from suffering them, and so the
Deity has only done the best he could in the circumstances;
a solution obviously liable to the
same objection as that respecting Natural Evil.
There are three ways, says the Archbishop, in
which undue elections might have been prevented;
not creating a free agent&#8212;constant interference
with his free-will&#8212;removing him to another state
where he would not be tempted to go astray in his
choice. A fourth mode may, however, be
suggested&#8212;creating a free-agent without any inclination
to evil, or any temptation from external
objects. When our author disposes of the second
method, by stating that it assumes a constant
miracle, as great in the moral as altering the
course of the planets hourly would be in the material
universe, nothing can be more sound or
more satisfactory. But when he argues that our
whole happiness consists in a consciousness of
freedom of election, and that we should never
know happiness were we restrained in any particular,
<!-- Page 95 -->
it seems wholly inconceivable how he should
have omitted to consider the prodigious comfort of
a state in which we should be guaranteed against
any error or impropriety of choice; a state in
which we should both be unable to go astray and
always feel conscious of that security. He, however,
begs the question most manifestly in dealing
with the two other methods stated, by which undue
elections might have been precluded. &#8220;You
would have freedom,&#8221; says he, &#8220;without any inclination
to sin; but it may justly be doubted if
this is possible <i>in the present state of things</i>,&#8221; (chap.
v. s. 5, sub. 2); and again, in answering the
question why God did not remove us into another state
where no temptation could seduce us, he says: &#8220;It
is plain that <i>in the present state of things</i> it is impossible
for men to live without natural evils or
the danger of sinning.&#8221; (<i>Ib</i>.) Now the whole
question arises upon the constitution of the present
state of things. If that is allowed to be inevitable,
or is taken as a datum in the discussion, there
ceases to be any question at all.

<P>The doctrine of a chain of being is enlarged
upon, and with much felicity of illustration. But
it only wraps up the difficulty in other words,
without solving it. For then the question becomes
this&#8212;Why did the Deity create such a chain as
could not be filled up without misery? It is, indeed,
merely restating the fact of evil existing;
<!-- Page 96 -->
for whether we say there is suffering among sentient
beings&#8212;or the universe consists of beings
more or less happy, more or less miserable&#8212;or
there exists a chain of beings varying in perfection
and in felicity&#8212;it is manifestly all one proposition.
The remark of Bayle upon this view of
the subject is really not at all unsound, and is
eminently ingenious: &#8220;Would you defend a king
who should confine all his subjects of a certain
age in dungeons, upon the ground that if he did
not, many of the cells he had built must remain
empty?&#8221; The answer of Bishop Law to this remark
is by no means satisfactory. He says it
assumes that more misery than happiness exists.
Now, in this view of the question, the balance is
quite immaterial. The existence of any evil at all
raises the question as much as the preponderance
of evil over good, because the question conceives a
perfectly good Being, and asks how such a Being
can have permitted any evil at all. Upon this
part of the subject both King and Law have fallen
into an error which recent discoveries place in a
singularly clear light. They say that the argument
they are dealing with would lead to leaving
the earth to the brutes without human inhabitants.
But the recent discoveries in Fossil Osteology
have proved that the earth, for ages before the last
5,000 or 6,000 years, was left to the lower animals;
nay, that in a still earlier period of its existence
<!-- Page 97 -->
no animal life at all was maintained upon its surface.
So that, in fact, the foundation is removed
of the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> attempted by the
learned prelates.

<P>A singular argument is used towards the latter
end of the inquiry. When the Deity, it is said,
resolved to create other beings, He must of necessity
tolerate imperfect natures in his handiwork,
just as he must the equality of a circle's radii
when he drew a circle. Who does not perceive
the difference? The meaning of the word circle
is that the radii are all equal; this equality is a
necessary truth. But it is not shown that men
could not exist without the imperfections they
labor under. Yet this is the argument suggested
by these authors while complaining (chap. v. s.
5, sub. 7, div. 7), that Lactantius had not sufficiently
answered the Epicurean dilemma; it is
the substitute propounded to supply that father's
deficiency.&#8212;&#8220;When, therefore,&#8221; says the Archbishop,
&#8220;matter, motion and free-will are constituted,
the Deity must necessarily permit corruption
of things and the abuse of liberty, or something
worse, for these cannot be separated without a
contradiction, and God is no more important, because
he cannot separate equality of radii from a
circle.&#8221;&#8212;Chap. v. s. 5, subs. 7. If he could not
have created evil, he would not have been omnipotent;
if he would not, he must let his power lie
<!-- Page 98 -->
idle; and rejecting evil have rejected all the good.
&#8220;Thus,&#8221; exclaims the author with triumph and
self-complacency, &#8220;then vanishes this Herculean
argument which induced the Epicureans to discard
the good Deity, and the Manicheans to substitute
an evil one.&#8221; (<i>Ib.</i> subs. 7, <i>sub. fine.</i>) Nor is
the explanation rendered more satisfactory, or indeed
more intelligible, by the concluding passage
of all, in which we are told that &#8220;from a conflict
of two properties, namely, omnipotence and goodness,
evils necessarily arise. These attributes
amicably conspire together, and yet restrain and
limit each other.&#8221; It might have been expected
from hence that no evil at all should be found to
exist. &#8220;There is a kind of struggle and opposition
between them, whereof the evils in nature
bear the shadow and resemblance. Here, then,
and no where else, mar we find the primary and
most certain rise and origin of evils.&#8221;

<P>Such is this celebrated work; and it may safely
be affirmed that a more complete failure to overcome
a great and admitted difficulty&#8212;a more unsatisfactory
solution of an important question&#8212;is
not to be found in the whole history of metaphysical science.

<P>Among the authors who have treated of this
subject, a high place is justly given to Archdeacon
Bulguy, whose work on <i>Divine Benevolence</i> is always
referred to by Dr. Paley with great commendation.
<!-- Page 99 -->
But certain it is that this learned and
pious writer either had never formed to himself a
very precise notion of the real question under discussion,
namely, the compatibility of the appearances
which we see and which we consider as evil,
with a Being infinitely powerful as well as good;
or he had in his mind some opinions respecting
the divine nature, opinions of a limitary kind,
which he does not state distinctly, although he
constantly suffers them to influence his seasonings.
Hence, whenever he comes close to the
real difficulty he appears to beg the question. A
very few instances of what really pervades the
whole work will suffice to show how unsatisfactory
its general scope is, although it contains, like the
treatise of Dr. King and Dr. Law's Commentary,
many valuable observations on the details of the
subject.

<P>And first we may perceive that what he terms a
&#8220;<i>previous remark,</i>&#8221; and desires the reader &#8220;to
carry along through the whole proof of divine
benevolence,&#8221; really contains a statement that <i>the
difficulty is to be evaded and not met.</i> &#8220;An intention
of producing good,&#8221; says he, &#8220;will be sufficiently
apparent in any particular instance if the
thing considered can neither be changed nor taken
away without loss or harm, <i>all other things continuing
the same.</i> Should you suppose <i>various</i>
things in the system changed <i>at once</i>, you can
<!-- Page 100 -->
neither judge of the possibility nor the consequences
of the changes, having no degree of experience
to direct you.&#8221; Now assuredly this
postulate makes the whole question as easy a one
as ever metaphysician or naturalist had to solve.
For it is no longer&#8212;Why did a powerful and benevolent
Being create a world in which there is
evil&#8212;but only&#8212;The world being given, how far
are its different arrangements consistent with one
another? According to this, the earthquake at
Lisbon, Voltaire's favorite instance, destroyed
thousands of persons, because it is in the nature
of things that subterraneous vapors should explode,
and that when houses fall on human beings
they should be killed. Then if Dr. Balguy goes
to his other argument, on which be often dwells,
that if this nature were altered, we cannot possibly
tell whether worse might not ensue; this, too, is
assuming a limited power in the Deity, contrary
to the hypothesis. It may most justly be said,
that if there be any one supposition necessarily
excluded from the whole argument, it is the fundamental
supposition of the &#8220;previous remark,&#8221;
namely, &#8220;all other things continuing the same.&#8221;

<P>But see how this assumption pervades and paralyzes
the whole argument, rendering it utterly
inconclusive. The author is to answer an objection
derived from the constitution of our appetites
for food, and his reply is, that &#8220;we cannot tell
<!-- Page 101 -->
how far it was <i>possible</i> for the stomachs and palates
of animals to be differently formed, unless by
some remedy worse than the disease.&#8221; Again,
upon the question of pain: &#8220;How do we know
that it was <i>possible</i> for the uneasy sensation to be
confined to particular cases?&#8221; So we meet the
same fallacy under another form, as evil being the
result of &#8220;general principles.&#8221; But no one has
ever pushed this so far as Dr. Balguy, for he says,
&#8220;that in a government so conducted, many events
are likely to happen contrary to the intention of
its author.&#8221; He now calls in the aid of chance, or
accident.&#8212;&#8220;It is probable,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that God
should be good, for evil is more likely to be <i>accidental</i>
than appears from experience in the conduct
of men.&#8221; Indeed, his fundamental position
of the Deity's benevolence is rested upon this
foundation, that &#8220;pleasures only were intended,
and that the pains are accidental consequences,
although the means of producing pleasures.&#8221; The
same recourse to accident is repeatedly had.
Thus, &#8220;the events to which we are exposed in
this imperfect state appear to be the <i>accidental</i>, not
natural, effects of our frame and condition.&#8221; Now
can any one thing be more manifest than that the
very first notion of a wise and powerful Being excludes
all such assumptions as things happening
contrary to His intention; and that when we use
the word chance or accident, which only means
<!-- Page 102 -->
our human ignorance of causes, we at once give
up the whole question, as if we said, &#8220;It is a subject
about which we know nothing.&#8221; So again as
to power. &#8220;A good design is more <i>difficult</i> to be
executed, and therefore more likely to be executed
<i>imperfectly</i>, than an evil one, that is, with a mixture
of effects foreign to the design and opposite
to it.&#8221; This at once assumes the Deity to be
powerless. But a general statement is afterwards
made more distinctly to the same effect. &#8220;Most
sure it is that he can do all things possible. But
are we in any degree competent judges of the
bounds of possibility?&#8221; So again under another
form nature is introduced as something different
from its author, and offering limits to his power.
&#8220;It is plainly not the method of nature to obtain
her ends instantaneously.&#8221; Passing over such
propositions as that &#8220;<i>useless</i> evil is a thing never
seen,&#8221; (when the whole question is why the same
ends were not attained without evil), and a variety
of other subordinate assumptions contrary to the
hypothesis, we may rest with this general statement,
which almost every page of Dr. Balguy's
book bears out, that the question which be has set
himself to solve is anything rather than the real
one touching the Origin of Evil; and that this
attempt at a solution is as ineffectual as any of
those which we have been considering.

<P>Is, then, the question wholly incapable of solution,
<!-- Page 103 -->
which all these learned and ingenious men
have so entirely failed in solving? Must the
difficulty remain forever unsurmounted, and only
be approached to discover that it is insuperable?
<i>Must the subject, of all others the most interesting
for us to know well, be to us always as a sealed
book, of which we can never know anything?</i> From
the nature of the thing&#8212;from the question relating
to the operation of a power which, to our
limited faculties, must ever be incomprehensible&#8212;there
seems too much reason for believing that
nothing precise or satisfactory ever will be attained
by human reason regarding this great
argument; and that the bounds which limit our
views will only be passed when we have quitted
the encumbrances of our mortal state, and are permitted
to survey those regions beyond the sphere
of our present circumscribed existence. The
other branch of Natural Theology, that which investigates
the evidences of Intelligence and Design,
and leads us to a clear apprehension of the
Deity's power and wisdom, is as satisfactorily
cultivated as any other department of science,
rests upon the same species of proof, and affords
results as precise as they are sublime. This
branch will never be distinctly known, and will
always so disappoint the inquirer as to render the
lights of Revelation peculiarly acceptable, although
even those lights leave much of it still
<!-- Page 104 -->
involved in darkness&#8212;still mysterious and obscure.<A NAME="S2"
HREF="#R2"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></A>

<P>Yet let us endeavor to suggest some possible
explication, while we admit that nothing certain,
nothing entirely satisfactory can be reached. The
failure of the great writers whose works we have
been contemplating may well teach us humility,
make us distrust ourselves, and moderate within
us any sanguine hopes of success. But they
should not make us wholly despair of at least
showing in what direction the solution of the difficulty
is to be sought, and whereabouts it will
probably be found situated, when our feeble reason
shall be strengthened and expanded. For one
cause of their discomfiture certainly has been their
aiming too high, attempting a complete solution
of a problem which only admitted of approximation,
and discussion of limits.

<P>It is admitted on all hands that the demonstration
is complete which shows the existence of intelligence
and design in the universe. The
structure of the eye and ear in exact confirmity to
the laws of optics and acoustics, shows as clearly
as any experiment can show anything, that the
source, cause or origin is common both to the
<!-- Page 105 -->
properties of light and the formation of the lenses
and retina in the eye&#8212;both to the properties of
sound and the tympanum, malleus, incus and
stapes of the ear. No doubt whatever can exist
upon the subject, any more than, if we saw a particular
order issued to a body of men to perform
certain uncommon evolutions, and afterwards saw
the same body performing those same evolutions,
we could doubt their having received the order.
A designing and intelligent and skillful author of
these admirably adapted works is equally a clear
inference from the same facts. We can no more
doubt it than we can question, when we see a mill
grinding corn into flour, that the machinery was
made by some one who designed by means of it to
prepare the materials of bread. The same conclusions
are drawn in a vast variety of other instances,
both with respect to the parts of human and other
bodies, and with respect to most of the other arrangements
of nature. Similar conclusions are
also drawn from our consciousness, and the knowledge
which it gives us of the structure of the
mind.<A NAME="S3" HREF="#R3"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></A>
Thus we find that attention quickens
<!-- Page 106 -->
memory and enables us to recollect; and that
habit renders all exertions and all acquisitions
easy, beside having the effect of alleviating pain.

<P>But when we carry our survey into other parts,
whether of the natural or moral system, we cannot
discover any design at all. We frequently perceive
structures the use of which we know nothing
about; parts of the animal frame that apparently
have no functions to perform&#8212;nay, that are the
source of pain without yielding any perceptible
advantage; arrangements and movements of bodies
which are of one particular kind, and yet we are
quite at a loss to discern any reason why they
might not have been of many other descriptions;
operations of nature that seem to serve no purpose
whatever; and other operations and other arrangements,
chosen equally without any beneficial view,
and yet which often give rise to much apparent
confusion and mischief. Now, the question is,
<i>first</i>, whether in any one of these cases of arrangement
and structures with no visible object at all,
we can for a moment suppose that there really is
no object answered, or only conceive that we have
been unable to discover it? <i>Secondly</i>, whether in
the cases where mischief sometimes is perceived,
and no other purpose appears to be effected, we do
not almost as uniformly lay the blame on our own
ignorance, and conclude, not that the arrangement
was made without any design, and that mischief
<!-- Page 107 -->
arises without any contriver, but that if we knew
the whole case we should find a design and contrivance,
and also that the apparent mischief would
sink into the general good? It is not necessary
to admit, for our present purpose, this latter proposition,
though it brings us closer to the matter in
hand; it is sufficient for the present to admit, what
no one doubts, that when a part of the body, for
instance, is discovered, to which, like the spleen,
we cannot assign any function in the animal system,
we never think of concluding that it is made
for no use, but only that we have as yet not been
able to discover its use.

<P>Now, let us ask, why do we, without any hesitation
whatever, or any exception whatever, always
and immediately arrive at this conclusion
respecting intelligence and design? Nothing
could be more unphilosophical, nay, more groundless,
than such a process of reasoning, if we had
only been able to trace design in one or two instances;
for instance, if we found only the eye to
show proofs of contrivance, it would be wholly
gratuitous, when we saw the ear, to assume that it
was adapted to the nature of sound, and still more
so, if, on examination, we perceived it bore no
perceptible relation to the laws of acoustics. The
proof of contrivance in one particular is nothing
like a proof, nay, does not even furnish the least
presumption of contrivance in other particulars;
<!-- Page 108 -->
because, <i>a priori</i>, it is just as easy to suppose one
part of nature to be designed for a purpose, and
another part, nay, all other parts, to be formed at
random and without any contrivance, as to suppose
that the formation of the whole is governed
by design. Why, then, do we, invariably and
undoubtedly, adopt the course of reasoning which
has been mentioned, and never for a moment suspect
anything to be formed without some reason&#8212;some
rational purpose? The only ground of this
belief is, that we have been able distinctly to trace
design in so vast a majority of cases as leaves us
no power of doubting that, if our faculties had
been sufficiently powerful, or our, investigation
sufficiently diligent, we should also have been able
to trace it in those comparatively few instances respecting
which we still are in the dark.

<P>It may be worth while to give a few instances of
the ignorance in which we once were of design in
some important arrangements of nature, and of the
knowledge which we now possess to show the purpose
of their formation. Before Sir Isaac Newton's
optical discoveries, we could not tell why the
structure of the eye was so complex, and why
several lenses and humors were required to form a
picture of objects upon the retina. Indeed, until
Dolland's subsequent discovery of the achromatic
effect of combining various glasses, and Mr. Blair's
still more recent experiments on the powers of
<!-- Page 109 -->
different refracting media, we were not able distinctly
to perceive the operation and use of the
complicacy in the structure of the eye. We now
well understand its nature, and are able to comprehend
how that which had at one time, nay, for
ages, seemed to be an unnecessary complexity;
forms the most perfect of all optical instruments,
and according to the most certain laws of refraction
and of dispersion.

<P>So, too, we had observed for some centuries the
forms of the orbits in which the heavenly bodies
move, and we had found these to be ellipses with
a very small eccentricity. But why this was the
form of those orbits no one could even conjecture.
If any person, the most deeply skilled in mathematical
science, and the most internally convinced
of the universal prevalence of design and contrivance
in the structure of the universe, had been
asked what reason there was for the planets moving
in ellipses so, nearly approaching to circles, he
could not have given any good reason, at least beyond
a guess. The force of gravitation, even
admitting that to be, as it were, a condition of the
creation of matter, would have made those bodies
revolve in ellipses of any degree of eccentricity
just as well, provided the angle and the force of
projection had been varied. Then, why was this
form rather, than any other chosen? No one
knew; yet no one doubted that there was ample
<!-- Page 110 -->
reason for it. Accordingly the sublime discoveries
of Lagrange and La Place have shown us that this
small eccentricity is one material element in the
formula by which it is shown that all the irregularities
of the system are periodical, and that the
deviation never can exceed a certain amount on
either hand.

<P>But, again, while we are ignorant of this, perhaps
the most sublime truth in all science, we
were always arguing as if the system had an imperfection,
as if the disturbing forces of the different
planets and the sun, acting on one another,
constantly changed the orbits of each planet, and
must, in a course of ages, work the destruction of
the whole planetary arrangement which we had
contemplated with so great admiration and with
awe. It was deemed enough if we could show
that this derangement must be extremely slow,
and that, therefore, the system might last for many
more ages without requiring any interposition of
omnipotent skill to preserve it by rectifying its
motions. Thus one of the most celebrated writers
above cited argues that, &#8220;from the nature of gravitation
and the concentricity of the orbits, the irregularities
produced are so slowly operated in
contracting, dilating and inclining those orbits,
that the system may go on for many thousand
years before any extraordinary interference becomes
necessary in order to correct it.&#8221; And Dr.
<!-- Page 111 -->
Burnett adds, that &#8220;those small irregularities cast
no discredit on the good contrivance of the whole.&#8221;
Nothing, however, could cast greater discredit if it
were as he supposed, and as all men previous to
the late discoveries supposed; it was only, they
rather think, a &#8220;small irregularity,&#8221; which was
every hour tending to the destruction of the whole
system, and which must have deranged or confounded
its whole structure long before it destroyed
it. Yet now we see that the wisdom, to
which a thousand years are as one day, not satisfied
with constructing a fabric which might last
for &#8220;many thousand years without His interference,&#8221;
has so formed it that it may thus endure
forever.

<P>Now if such be the grounds of our belief in the
universal prevalence of Design, and such the different
lights which at different periods of our
progress in science we possess upon this branch
of the divine government; if we undoubtingly believe
that contrivance is universal only because
we can trace and comprehend it in a great majority
of instances, and if the number of exceptions to
the rule is occasionally diminished as our knowledge
of the particulars is from time to time extended&#8212;may
we not apply the same principle to
the apprehension of Benevolent purpose, and infer
from the number of instances in which we plainly
perceive a good intention, that if we were better
<!-- Page 112 -->
acquainted with those cases in which a contrary
intention is now apparent, we should there, too,
find the generally pervading character of Benevolence
to prevail? Not only is this the manner in
which we reason respecting the Design of the Creator
from examining his works; it is the manner
in which we treat the conduct of our fellow-creatures.
A man of the most extensive benevolence
and strictest integrity in his general deportment
has done something equivocal; nay, something
apparently harsh and cruel; we are slow to condemn
him; we give him credit for acting with a
good motive and for a righteous purpose; we rest
satisfied that &#8220;if we only knew everything he
would come out blameless.&#8221; This arises from a
just and a sound view of human character, and its
general consistency with itself. The same reasoning
may surely be applied with all humility and
reverence, to the works and the intentions of the
great Being who has implanted in our minds the
principles which lead to that just and sound view
of the deeds and motives of men.

<P>But let the argument be rested upon our course
of reasoning respecting divine contrivance. The
existence of Evil is in no case more apparent than
the existence of Disorder seems to be in many
things. To go no further than the last example
which has been given&#8212;the mathematician could
perceive the derangement in the planetary orbits,
<!-- Page 113 -->
could demonstrate that it must ensue from the
mutual action of the heavenly bodies on each
other, could calculate its progress with the utmost
exactness, could tell with all nicety how much it
would alter the forms of the orbits in a given time,
could foresee the time when the whole system
must be irretrievably destroyed by its operation as
a mathematical certainty. Nothing, that we call
evil can be much more certainly perceived than
this derangement, of itself an evil, certainly a
great imperfection, if the system was observed by
the mind of man as we regard human works. Yet
we now find, from well considering some things
which had escaped attention, that the system is
absolutely free from derangement; that all the
disturbances counterbalance each other; and that
the orbits never can either be flattened or bulged
out beyond a definite or very inconsiderable quantity.
Can any one doubt that there is also a reason
for even the small and limited, this regular and
temporary derangement? Why it exists at all, or
in any the least degree, we as yet know not. But
who will presume to doubt that it has a reason
which would at once satisfy our minds were it
known to us? Nay, who will affirm that the discovery
of it may not yet be in reserve for some
later and happier age? Then are we not entitled
to apply the same reasoning to what at present
appears Evil in a system of which, after all we
<!-- Page 114 -->
know of it, so much still remains concealed from
our view?

<P>The mere act of creation in a Being of wisdom
so admirable and power so vast, seems to make it
extremely probable that perfect goodness accompanies
the exertion of his perfect skill. There is
something so repugnant to all our feelings, but
also to all the conceptions of our reason, in the
supposition of such a Being desiring the misery,
for its own sake, of the Beings whom he voluntarily
called into existence and endowed with a
sentient nature, that the mind naturally and irresistibly
recoils from such a thought. But this is
not all. If the nature of that great Being were
evil, his power being unbounded, there would be
some proportion between the amounts of ills and
the monuments of that power. Yet we are struck
dumb with the immensity of His works to which
no imperfection can be ascribed, and in which no
evil can be traced, while the amount of mischief
that we see might sink into a most insignificant
space; and is such as a being of inconsiderable
power and very limited skill could easily have accomplished.
This is not the same consideration
with the balance of good against evil; and inquirers
do not seem to have sufficiently attended
to it. The argument, however, deserves much attention,
for it is purely and strictly inductive.
The divine nature is shown to be clothed with prodigious
<!-- Page 115 -->
power and incomparable wisdom and skill,&#8212;power
and skill so vast and so exceeding our
comprehension that we ordinarily term them infinite,
and are only inclined to conceive the possibility
of limiting, by the course of the argument
upon evil, one alternative of which is assumed to
raise an exception. But admitting on account of
the question under discussion, that we have only
a right to say that power and skill are prodigiously
great, though possibly not boundless, they are
plainly shown in the phenomena of the universe
to be the attributes of a Being, who, if evil-disposed,
could have made the monuments of Ill upon
a scale resembling those of Power and Skill; so
that if those things which seem to us evil be really
the result of a mischievous design in such a Being,
we cannot comprehend why they are upon so entirely
different a scale. This is a strong presumption
from the facts that we are wrong in imputing
those appearances to such a disposition. If so,
what seems evil must needs be capable of some
other explanation consistent with divine goodness&#8212;that
is to say, would not prove to be evil at all
if we knew the whole of those facts.

<P>But it is necessary to proceed a step further,
especially with a view to the fundamental position
now contended for, the extending to the question
of Benevolence the same principles which we apply
to that of Intelligence. The evil which exists,
<!-- Page 116 -->
or that which we suppose to be evil, not only is of
a kind and a magnitude requiring inconceivably
less power and less skill than the admitted good
of the creation&#8212;it also bears a very small proportion
in amount; quite as small a proportion as the
cases of unknown or undiscoverable design bear to
those of acknowledged and proved contrivance.
Generally speaking, the preservation and the
happiness of sensitive creatures appears to be the
great object of creative exertion and conservative
providence. The expanding of our faculties, both
bodily and mentally, is accompanied with pleasure;
the exercise of those powers is almost always attended
with gratification; all labor so acts as to
make rest peculiarly delicious; much of labor is
enjoyment; the gratification of those appetites by
which both the individual is preserved and the
race is continued, is highly pleasurable to all animals;
and it must be observed that instead of
being attracted by grateful sensations to do anything
requisite for our good or even our existence,
we might have been just as certainly urged by
the feeling of pain, or the dread of it, which is a
kind of suffering in itself. Nature, then, resembles
the law-giver who, to make his subjects obey,
should prefer holding out rewards for compliance
with his commands rather than denounce punishments
for disobedience. But nature is yet more
kind; she is gratuitously kind; she not only prefers
<!-- Page 117 -->
inducement to threat or compulsion, but she
adds more gratification than was necessary to make
us obey her calls. How well might all creation
have existed and been continued, though the air
had not been balmy in spring, or the shade and
the spring refreshing in summer; had the earth
not been enamelled with flowers; and the air
scented with perfumes! How needless for the
propagation of plants was it that the seed should
be enveloped in fruits the most savory to our
palate, and if those fruits serve some other purpose,
how foreign to that purpose was the formation
of our nerves so framed as to be soothed or
excited by their flavor! We here perceive design,
because we trace adaptation. But we at the same
time perceive benevolent design, because we perceive
gratuitous and supererogatory enjoyment bestowed.
Thus, too, see the care with which animals
of all kinds are tended from their birth. The
mother's instinct is not more certainly the means
of securing and providing for her young, than her
gratification in the act of maternal care is great
and is also needless for making her perform that
duty. The grove is not made vocal during pairing
and incubation, in order to secure the laying or
the hatching of eggs; for if it were as still as the
grave, or were filled with the most discordant
croaking, the process would be as well performed.
So, too, mark the care with which injuries are
<!-- Page 118 -->
remedied by what has been correctly called the <i>vis
medicatrix</i>. Is a muscle injured?&#8212;Suppuration
takes place, the process of granulation succeeds,
and new flesh is formed to supply the gap, or if
that is less wide, a more simple healing process
knits together the severed parts. Is a bone injured?&#8212;A
process commences by which an extraordinary
secretion of bony matter takes place,
and the void is supplied. Nay, the irreparable injury
of a joint gives rise to the formation of a new
hinge, by which the same functions may be not
inconveniently, though less perfectly, performed.
Thus, too, recovery of vigor after sickness is provided
for by increased appetite; but there is here
superadded, generally, a feeling of comfort and
lightness, an enjoyment of existence so delightful,
that it is a common remark how nearly this compensates
the sufferings of the illness. In the
economy of the mind it is the same thing. All
our exertions are stimulated by curiosity, and the
gratification is extreme of satisfying it. But it
might have been otherwise ordered, and some
painful feeling might have been made the only
stimulant to the acquisition of knowledge. So,
the charm of novelty is proverbial; but it might
have been the unceasing cause of the most painful
alarms. Habit renders every thing easy; but the
repetition might have only increased the annoyance.
The loss of one organ makes the others
<!-- Page 119 -->
more acute. But the partial injury might have
caused, as it were, a general paralysis. 'Tis thus
that Paley is well justified in exclaiming, &#8220;It is a
happy world after all!&#8221; The pains and the sufferings,
bodily and mental, to which we are exposed,
if they do not sink into nothing, at least retreat
within comparatively narrow bounds; the ills are
hardly seen when we survey the great and splendid
picture of worldly enjoyment or ease.

<P>But the existence of considerable misery is undeniable:
and the question is, of course, confined
to that. Its exaggeration, in the ordinary estimate
both of the vulgar and of skeptical reasoners, is
equally certain. Paley, Bishop Sumner, as well
as Derham, King, Ray and others of the older
writers, have made many judicious and generally
correct observations upon its amount, and they, as
well as some of the able and learned authors of
the <i>Bridgwater Treatises</i>, have done much in establishing
deductions necessary to be made, in
order that we may arrive at the true amount.
That many things, apparently unmixed evils,
when examined more narrowly, prove to be partially
beneficial, is the fair result of their well-meant
labors; and this, although anything rather
than a proof that there is no evil at all, yet is valuable
as still further proving the analogy between
this branch of the argument and that upon design;
and in giving hopes that all may possibly
<!-- Page 120 -->
be found hereafter to be good, as everything will
assuredly be found to be contrived with an intelligent
and useful purpose. It may be right to add
a remark or two upon some evils, and those of the
greatest magnitude in the common estimate of
human happiness, with a view of further illustrating
this part of the subject.

<P>Mere imperfection must altogether be deducted
from the account. It never can be contended that
any evil nature can be ascribed to the first cause,
merely for not having endowed sentient creatures
with greater power or wisdom, for not having increased
and multiplied the sources of enjoyment,
or for not having made those pleasures which we
have more exquisitely grateful. No one can be so
foolish as to argue that the Deity is either limited
in power, or deficient in goodness, because he has
chosen to create some beings of a less perfect order
than others. The mere negation in the creating
of some, indeed of many, nay, of any conceivable
number of desirable attributes, is therefore no
proper evidence of evil design or of limited power
in the Creator&#8212;it is no proof of the existence of
evil properly so called. But does not this also
erase death from the catalogue of ills? It might
well please the Deity to create a mortal being
which, consisting of soul and body, was only to
live upon this earth for a limited number of years.
If, when that time has expired, this being is removed
<!-- Page 121 -->
to another and a superior state of existence,
no evil whatever accrues to it from the change;
and all views of the government of this world lead
to the important and consolitary conclusion, that
such is the design of the Creator; that he cannot
have bestowed on us minds capable of such expansion
and culture only to be extinguished when
they have reached their highest pitch of improvement;
or if this be considered as begging the
question by assuming benevolent design, we cannot
easily conceive that while the mind's force is
so little affected by the body's decay, the destruction
or dissolution of the latter should be the extinction
of the former. But that death operates as
an evil of the very highest kind in two ways is
obvious; the dread of it often embitters life, and
the death of friends brings to the mind by far its
most painful infliction; certainly the greatest suffering
it can undergo without any criminal consciousness
of its own.

<P>For this evil, then&#8212;this grievous and admitted
evil&#8212;how shall we account? But first let us
consider whether it be not unavoidable; not merely
under the present dispensation, and in the existing
state of things; for that is wholly irrelevant
to the question which is raised upon the fitness of
this very state of things; but whether it be not a
necessary evil. That man might have been
created immortal is not denied; but if it were the
<!-- Page 122 -->
will of the Deity to form a limited being and to
place him upon the earth for only a certain period
of time, his death was the necessary consequence
of this determination. Then as to the pain which
one person's removal inflicts upon surviving parties,
this seems the equally necessary consequence
of their having affections. For if any being feels
love towards another, this implies his desire that
the intercourse with that other should continue;
or what is the same thing, the repugnance and
aversion to its ceasing; that is, he must suffer affliction
for that removal of the beloved object. To
create sentient beings devoid of all feelings of affection
was no doubt possible to Omnipotence;
but to endow those beings with such feelings as
would give the constant gratification derived from
the benevolent affections, and yet to make them
wholly indifferent to the loss of the objects of those
affections, was not possible even for Omnipotence;
because it was a contradiction in terms, equivalent
to making a thing both exist and not exist at one
and the same time. Would there have been any
considerable happiness in a life stripped of these
kindly affections? We cannot affirm that there
would not, because we are ignorant what other enjoyments
might have been substituted for the indulgence
of them. But neither can we affirm that
any such substitution could have been found; and
it lies upon those who deny the necessary connection
<!-- Page 123 -->
between the human mind, or any sentient
being's mind, and grief for the loss of friends, to
show that there are other enjoyments which could
furnish an equivalent to the gratification derived
from the benevolent feelings. The question then
reduces itself to this: Wherefore did a being, who
could have made sentient beings immortal, choose
to make them mortal? or, Wherefore has he
placed man upon the earth for a time only? or,
Wherefore has he set bounds to the powers and
capacities which he has been pleased to bestow
upon his creatures? And this is a question which
we certainly never shall be able to solve; but a
question extremely different from the one more
usually put&#8212;How happens it that a good being
has made a world full of misery and death?

<P>In the necessary ignorance wherein we are of
the whole designs of the Deity, we cannot wonder
if some things, nay, if many things, are to our
faculties inscrutable. But we assuredly have no
right to say that those difficulties which try and
vex us are incapable of a solution, any more than
we have to say, that those cases in which as yet
we can see no trace of design, are not equally the
result of intelligence, and equally conducive to a
fixed and useful purpose with those in which we
have been able to perceive the whole, or nearly
the whole scheme. Great as have been our
achievements in physical astronomy, we are as yet
<!-- Page 124 -->
wholly unable to understand why a power pervades
the system acting inversely as the squares of the
distance from the point to which it attracts, rather
than a power acting according to any other law;
and why it has been the pleasure of the almighty
Architect of that universe, that the orbits of the
planets should be nearly circular instead of approaching
to, or being exactly the same with many
other trajectories of a nearly similar form, though
of other properties; nay, instead of being curves
of a wholly different class and shape. Yet we
never doubt that there was a reason for this choice;
nay, we fancy it possible that even on earth we
may hereafter understand it more clearly than we
now do: and never question that in another state
of being we may be permitted to enjoy the contemplation
of it. Why should we doubt that, at
least in that higher state, we may also be enabled
to perceive such an arrangement as shall make
evil wholly disappear from our present system, by
showing that it was necessary and inevitable, even
in the works of the Deity; or, which is the same
thing, that its existence conduces to such a degree
of perfection and happiness upon, the whole, as
could not, even by Omnipotence, be attained without
it; or, which is the same thing, that the whole
creation as it exists, taking both worlds together, is
perfect, and incapable of being in any particular
changed without being made worse and less perfect?
<!-- Page 125 -->
Taking both worlds together&#8212;For certainly
were our views limited to the present sublunary
state, we may well affirm that no solution whatever
could even be imagined of the difficulty&#8212;if
we are never again to live; if those we here loved
are forever lost to us; if our faculties can receive
no further expansion; if our mental powers are
only trained and improved to be extinguished at
their acme&#8212;then indeed are we reduced to the
melancholy and gloomy dilemma of the Epicureans;
and evil is confessed to checker, nay,
almost to cloud over our whole lot, without the
possibility of comprehending why, or of reconciling
its existence with the supposition of a providence
at once powerful and good. But this inference is
also an additional argument for a future state,
when we couple it with these other conclusions
respecting the economy of the world to which we
are led by wholly different routes, when we investigate
the phenomena around us and within us.

<P>Suppose, for example, it should be found that
there are certain purposes which can in no way
whatever&#8212;no conceivable way&#8212;be answered except
by placing man in a state of trial or probation;
suppose the essential nature of mind shall
be found to be such that it could not in any way
whatever exist so as to be capable of the greatest
purity and improvement&#8212;in other words, the
highest perfection&#8212;without having undergone a
<!-- Page 126 -->
probation; or suppose it should be found impossible
to communicate certain enjoyments to rational
and sentient beings without having previously
subjected them to certain trials and certain sufferings&#8212;as,
for instance, the pleasures derived from
a consciousness of perfect security, the certainty
that we can suffer and perish no more&#8212;this
surely is a possible supposition. Now, to continue
the last example&#8212;Whatever pleasure there is in
the contrast between ease and previous vexation
or pain, whatever enjoyment we derive from the
feeling of absolute security after the vexation and
uncertainty of a precarious state, implies a previous
suffering&#8212;a previous state of precarious
enjoyment; and not only implies it but necessarily
implies it, so that the power of Omnipotence itself
could not convey to us the enjoyment without
having given us the previous suffering. Then is
it not possible that the object of an all powerful
and perfectly benevolent being should be to create
like beings, to whom as entire happiness, as complete
and perfect enjoyment, should be given as
any created beings&#8212;that is, any being, except the
Creator himself&#8212;can by possibility enjoy? This
is certainly not only a very possible supposition,
but it appears to be quite consistent with, if it be
not a necessary consequence of, his being perfectly
good as well as powerful and wise. Now we have
shown, therefore, that such being supposed the
<!-- Page 127 -->
design of Providence, even Omnipotence itself
could not accomplish this design, as far as one
great and important class of enjoyments is concerned,
without the previous existence of some
pain, some misery. Whatever gratification arises
from relief&#8212;from contrast&#8212;from security succeeding
anxiety&#8212;from restoration of lost affections&#8212;from
renewing severed connections&#8212;and
many others of a like kind, could not by any possibility
be enjoyed unless the correlative suffering
had first been undergone. Nor will the argument
be at all impeached by observing, that one Being
may be made to feel the pleasure of ease and security
by seeing others subjected to suffering and
distress; for that assumes the infliction of misery
on those others; it is &#8220;<i>alterius</i> spectare laborem&#8221;
that we are supposing to be sweet; and this is still
partial evil.

<P>As the whole argument respecting evil must,
from the nature of the question, resolve itself into
either a proof of some absolute or mathematical
necessity not to be removed by infinite power, or
the showing that some such proof may be possible
although we have not yet discovered it, an illustration
may naturally be expected to be attainable
from mathematical considerations. Thus, we have
already adverted to the law of periodical irregularities
in the solar system. Any one before it
was discovered seemed entitled to expatiate upon
<!-- Page 128 -->
the operation of the disturbing forces arising from
mutual attraction, and to charge the system arranged
upon the principle of universal gravitation
with want of skill, nay, with leading to inevitable
mischief&#8212;mischief or evil of so prodigious an extent
as to exceed incalculably all the instances of
evil and of suffering which we see around us in
this single planet. Nevertheless, what then appeared
so clearly to be a defect and an evil, is now
well known to be the very absolute perfection of
the whole heavenly architecture.

<P>Again, we may derive a similar illustration from
a much more limited instance, but one immediately
connected with strict mathematical reasoning,
and founded altogether in the nature of necessary
truth. The problem has been solved by mathematicians,
Sir Isaac Newton having first investigated
it, of finding the form of a symmetrical
solid, or solid of revolution, which in moving
through a fluid shall experience the least possible
resistance. The figure bears a striking resemblance
to that of a fish. Now suppose a fish were
formed exactly in this shape, and that some animal
endowed with reason were placed upon a portion
of its surface, and able to trace its form for only a
limited extent, say at the narrow part, where the
broad portion or end of the moving body were opposed,
or seemed as if it were opposed, to the surrounding
fluid when the fish moved&#8212;the reasoner
<!-- Page 129 -->
would at once conclude that the contrivance of the
fish's form was very inconvenient, and that nothing
could be much worse adapted for expeditious
or easy movement through the waters.

<P>Yet it is certain that upon being afterwards permitted
to view THE WHOLE body of the fish, what
had seemed a defect and an evil, not only would
appear plainly to be none at all, but it would appear
manifest that this seeming evil or defect was
a part of the most perfect and excellent structure
which it was possible even for Omnipotence and
Omniscience to have adopted, and that no other
conceivable arrangement could by possibility have
produced so much advantage, or tended so much
to fulfill the design in view. Previous to being
enlightened by such an enlarged view of the whole
facts, it would thus be a rash and unphilosophical
thing in the reasoner whose existence we are supposing
to pronounce an unfavorable opinion. Still
more unwise would it be if numerous other observations
had evinced traces of skill and goodness in
the fish's structure. The true and the safe conclusion
would be to suspend an opinion which
could only be unsatisfactorily formed upon imperfect
data; and to rest in the humble hope and belief
that one day all would appear for the best.

files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

donate.

deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
